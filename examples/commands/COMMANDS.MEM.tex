   The §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[Commands] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual]  is  an  alphabetically-arranged
   description of all operating system commands (EXEC commands) available
   to the nonprivileged timesharing user of TOPS-20.

   In addition, there are two appendixes for quick reference - a list  of
   commands  grouped by function, and an alphabetical summary of commands
   showing what variety of argument each uses  and  whether  it  calls  a
   program or otherwise affects memory.

   To use the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[Commands]  §uline[Reference]  §uline[Manual]  properly,  you  should
   first  read  and  understand the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].  The occasional
   summary of information you will find here cannot  substitute  for  the
   more complete presentations offered in this manual.

   In addition, you may need to reference the following manuals for  more
   information related to operating system commands:

   §textbf[COMMANDS] §textbf[AND] §textbf[ARGUMENTS]

   A complete TOPS-20 command consists of the command  name  and  usually
   one  or  more arguments.  In the most general sense, arguments are any
   combinations  of  letters,  numerals,  punctuation  marks  and   other
   characters that you type after the command name itself to complete the
   meaning of the command.  These arguments can be  file  specifications,
   switches,  subcommands,  and  values  for switches and subcommands, as
   well as words and numbers (the  arguments  to  the  SET  and  TERMINAL
   commands,   for   example).    The  following  pages  contain  general
   information about each variety of argument.

   Information and programs for TOPS-20 are usually  stored  in  uniquely
   labeled  files.  Therefore, file specifications or "filespecs" are the
   most common variety  of  argument  to  a  command.   A  complete  file
   specification is of the form:

        dev:<dir>name.typ.gen;att;...;att

   where:

        dev:   is a device (usually a file structure)

        <dir>  is a directory name (enclosed in angle < > or  square  §lbrack[] §rbrack[]
               brackets)

        name   is a filename

        .typ   is a file type

        .gen   is a generation number

        ;att   is a file attribute



                                    1-1

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   You need file attributes in only a few situations and can usually  let
   dev:,  <dir>, and .gen take default values (that is, values defined by
   the state of your job   -  see the Special Features section below), so
   you can give most file specifications in the shortened form, name.typ,
   without being unclear.  In a few cases, an entire  file  specification
   is assumed if you do not supply one when you give the command (for the
   CREATE  and  EDIT  commands,   for   example,   and   for   LOAD-class
   commands - COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG).

   Whenever you omit the dev: field of the filespec, the  system  assumes
   you  mean  your  connected  structure  (DSK:).   This  is  the  public
   structure (usually named PS:), which all users must log in to,  unless
   you  connect  to a directory on another structure by using the CONNECT
   command.  Give the INFORMATION STRUCTURE command if you are unsure  of
   the name for your connected structure.

   Whenever you omit the <dir> field of the filespec, the system  assumes
   you  mean  your  connected directory.  Unless you have given a CONNECT
   command, this is your "log-in" directory, the directory on the  public
   structure  that  you  must  log  in  to  and  which usually has a name
   composed of your surname, or surname and initials, enclosed  in  angle
   or square brackets.  You can change your connected directory by giving
   a CONNECT command.  Use the DIRECTORY command to see the name of  your
   connected directory.

   When you omit the .gen  field  of  the  filespec  the  system  usually
   assumes you mean the highest generation (largest generation number) of
   the  file.   (A  few  commands,  for  example,  DELETE,  RENAME,   and
   DIRECTORY,  act  on  all  generations  of  a file unless you specify a
   particular generation.)  When you create and edit text files,  compile
   and  debug programs, or do anything else to produce another generation
   of a file, the system automatically works with  the  highest  existing
   generation and labels the changed file with the next higher generation
   number.  Therefore when you omit the generation number in  a  filespec
   given  as  argument to a TOPS-20 command, you are assured of using the
   most recent version of the  file.   Although  you  can  override  this
   default  action  by  specifying  particular  generations  of input and
   output files, it is simplest and most  straightforward  to  allow  the
   defaults to prevail.

   Specification  of  file  attributes  is  optional.   You  can   assign
   attributes  in  order to have a file automatically marked for deletion
   when you log out; to associate a file with a  valid  account;  and  so
   forth.  Appendix C lists the available file attributes.

   Pressing the ESC key instead of typing a filespec field  will  usually
   cause  any  default  for  the  remaining  fields to be printed on your
   terminal.

   There are two characters (called "wildcard" characters) that  you  can
   include  in  any field of a filespec to include all files matching the
   rest of the filespec.  An asterisk (*)  fills  in  for  zero  or  more


                                    1-2

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   characters  of a field, while a percent sign (%) fills in for a single
   character only.  (However, only the complete field "DSK*:" is  allowed
   as  wildcard  for the device field, and only the complete field "*" is
   allowed as wildcard for the generation field.)   Therefore  you  could
   give the command DIRECTORY *.CBL to find out what source files written
   in COBOL are in your connected directory, or the command  DELETE  *.Q*
   to remove the EDIT program's backup files from your directory.


   §textbf[Switches]

   Switches are arguments used with LOAD-class (COMPILE,  LOAD,  EXECUTE,
   and  DEBUG) and EDIT-class (CREATE and EDIT) commands, as well as with
   Queue-class commands - that is, those affecting entries in  processing
   queues  (CANCEL,  DISMOUNT,  MODIFY,  MOUNT,  PLOT,  PRINT, PUNCH, and
   SUBMIT).

   Switches can also be used with the following program-control commands:
   DDT,  GET,  MERGE,  R,  and  RUN.   The  REWIND command also accepts a
   switch.

   Switches allow you to quickly give many options chosen  from  a  large
   list, and let you specify to which files they apply when you give more
   than one filespec in a single command.

   Give switches on the same line as the  command,  typing  a  slash  (/)
   before  each  switch.   If  your  command requires more than one line,
   simply keep typing without giving a carriage return.  The system  will
   begin  a  new  line automatically and will read your command as if you
   had typed it on a single line.  Or you can end your  command  line  at
   any  point  with  a  hyphen  (-) and carriage return, and continue the
   command on the next line; the hyphen will not be  considered  part  of
   your input.

   Keep in mind  the  way  each  class  of  command  considers  switches.
   EDIT-class  commands  operate  on  only  one  file  at a time, and the
   switches must  be  given  before  the  input  filespec - this  is  the
   simplest case.

   Queue-class and LOAD-class commands treat switches according to  their
   position  in the command line.  If you give them before any filespecs,
   they act as default switches for all filespecs in  the  command  (they
   will  be  in  effect  unless  you  override  them  with later switches
   applying to individual files only).  If you give them after the  first
   filespec,  they  apply only to the preceding file.  In addition, there
   are a few switches of a different sort for the PLOT, PRINT, and  PUNCH
   commands - these apply to all files no matter where they appear in the
   command line.  These are called job switches (because they affect  the
   entire  printing  job)  and  are presented in a separate list in those
   command descriptions.

   A switch is a default if the system  assumes  it  in  the  absence  of


                                    1-3

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   others.  For example, for LOAD-class commands, /FORTRAN is the default
   for all switches that specify which  compiler  to  use  (like  /MACRO,
   /COBOL,  and  /PASCAL).   The  /NOCOMPILE  switch  is  the default for
   /COMPILE, /NOCOMPILE,  and  /RELOCATABLE.   Most  defaults  for  these
   commands  apply  to  only  a  pair  of switches; however, the /BINARY,
   /NOSEARCH, and /NOOPTIMIZE switches are assumed, for  example,  unless
   you specify /NOBINARY, /SEARCH, and /OPTIMIZE.

   Default switches for the other classes of command  operate  similarly.
   Some  are  in  effect unless you specify their opposite; others are in
   effect with a default argument unless you  specify  another  argument;
   still  others must be specified to be in effect, but are supplied with
   a default argument.  The list of switches presented with each  command
   description  distinguishes  these  cases.   When  you give two or more
   switches of the same kind (for example, /BINARY  and  /NOBINARY),  the
   last switch given usually prevails.


   §textbf[Subcommands]

   Subcommands  are  a   variety   of   arguments   used   chiefly   with
   DIRECTORY-class  (DIRECTORY,  FDIRECTORY,  TDIRECTORY, and VDIRECTORY)
   commands and with the BUILD command.  If you want to give  subcommands
   to any of the DIRECTORY-class commands, type a comma at the end of the
   command line just before pressing  the  carriage  return.   After  the
   system   prompts  you  with  a  double  at  sign  (@@)  you  can  give
   subcommands, one on each line.  If you  give  no  subcommands  to  the
   DIRECTORY command, the ALPHABETICAL and HEADING subcommands will be in
   effect,  giving  an  alphabetical  listing  of  files.   For   a   few
   subcommands,  default  arguments  will  be  in  effect if you give the
   subcommands without supplying any.  You can give  subcommands  in  any
   order,  requesting  or declining special categories of information and
   specifying the format of  its  presentation.   If  you  give  mutually
   exclusive  subcommands  (ALPHABETICAL  and CHRONOLOGICAL, for example)
   the  last-given  subcommand  prevails.   Note  that  the   FDIRECTORY,
   TDIRECTORY,  and  VDIRECTORY  commands are equivalent to the DIRECTORY
   command with certain subcommands automatically included,  and  can  be
   further  modified  with  other  subcommands from DIRECTORY's list.  To
   cancel a DIRECTORY-class command  while  giving  subcommands,  type  a
   CTRL/C.

   The BUILD command operates differently from  DIRECTORY-class  commands
   in  putting you automatically into subcommand mode without your typing
   a final  comma  on  the  command  line,  and  in  offering  a  special
   subcommand to cancel the command while you are typing subcommands.

   See the individual command descriptions for more detailed  information
   about subcommands.

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   §textbf[Other] §textbf[Arguments]

   Some command arguments are not introduced by special  characters  such
   as  slashes  or  double  at  signs, but still are particular words, or
   "keywords," having a special meaning to the system.  Give these on the
   same line as the command itself, leaving at least one space before and
   between arguments.  Certain of these (for example,  the  LOGICAL-NAMES
   argument  to  the  INFORMATION  command) are actually composed of more
   than one word, joined by hyphens so that the system will not interpret
   them  as more than one argument.  If the complete command will not all
   fit onto one line,  simply  keep  typing:   the  system  automatically
   begins  a  new line when necessary, but interprets the typing as if it
   had all appeared on one line.  Or you can end a command  line  at  any
   point  with  a  hyphen  (-)  and  a  carriage return, and continue the
   command on the next line; the hyphen will not be  considered  part  of
   your input.

   A few command arguments must be accompanied by special symbols  to  be
   interpreted correctly.  Enclose directory names in angle brackets when
   using them with the CONNECT or names (for DEFINE), device names  (used
   with  ASSIGN),  and  structures  and  tape  sets  (used  with MOUNT or
   DISMOUNT) all require a  colon  at  the  end.   (But  note  that  when
   supplying  what  look like structure and tape set names to the related
   CANCEL command, you are supplying jobnames, and must not  include  the
   colon.)  If  you  punctuate a command argument incorrectly, the system
   will usually print a message reminding you of this.


   §textbf[SPECIAL] §textbf[FEATURES]

   §textbf[Defaults]

   The concept of "defaults," or command arguments assumed  when  you  do
   not  specify  a  choice,  is  important for understanding TOPS-20.  To
   speed processing of commands and  to  help  inexperienced  users,  the
   system  uses  defaults when necessary for completing commands that you
   give.  By taking advantage of this defaulting action, you can make the
   system work faster and more efficiently for you.  This manual displays
   prominently  the  available  choices  of  command  arguments  and  the
   established defaults for these.

   There  are  different  kinds  of  default.    When   you   give   file
   specifications  as  arguments  to,  say, the PRINT command, the system
   assumes that you are referring to the highest (most recent) generation
   of  these  files  in your connected structure and connected directory.
   By specifying a different structure, directory, or generation you  can
   override  this  default,  but  only  if  you  already  have  the right
   (established by user membership in a group, perhaps,  or  by  a  prior
   ACCESS command) to do so.





                                    1-5

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   When you give the INFORMATION BATCH-REQUESTS command  without  further
   arguments,  you  are  presented  with a listing of all requests in the
   batch input queue.  The /USER switch allows you to limit this  display
   to  the  jobs  of  the  user  named.   If  you give the switch without
   supplying a user name, your own user name is used  as  default.   (But
   the  /USER  switch  to  the  related  SUBMIT  command  has meaning for
   privileged users only, who can use it to run batch  jobs  under  other
   user  names; for non-privileged users this switch effectively defaults
   to your own user name.)  Only a few command arguments behave like  the
   /USER switch.  The /TIME switch to the SUBMIT command is worth noting:
   by not giving the switch, you set a time limit of 5 minutes; by giving
   the  switch  without specifying a time limit, you are setting a 1-hour
   limit; and you can set  any  other  time  limit  by  supplying  it  as
   argument to the switch.

   Note that none of the three switches to INFORMATION BATCH-REQUESTS and
   INFORMATION  OUTPUT-REQUESTS  (/ALL,  /FAST,  and  /USER) is used as a
   default:  each calls for a listing that differs in some respects  from
   that  yielded  by  the  unmodified  command.  However, the INFORMATION
   LOGICAL-NAMES command, which allows keywords ALL, JOB, and SYSTEM, has
   JOB  as default for these.  The list of arguments associated with each
   command makes these choices clear.

   To discover what default  argument  (if  any)  is  established  for  a
   switch,  subcommand,  or  other argument, press the ESC key instead of
   giving the argument:  the default will be printed on your terminal.

   "Recognition" input is another feature of the TOPS-20 operating system
   that  speeds  up  your  input, by finishing the typing of a command or
   command argument for you when you have given only part of it and  then
   prompting your next response.

   As soon as  you  have  typed  enough  of  a  command  or  argument  to
   distinguish it from others, press the ESC key:  the system will finish
   the word, if possible, and prompt  your  next  input  with  guidewords
   enclosed  in  parentheses.   (Note  that  this  manual  does  not show
   guidewords except in the Format section of each command  description.)
   By  pressing  the  ESC  key without beginning an argument you make the
   system print the default argument, if there is  one.   If  the  system
   cannot  help  you, either because you have not typed enough characters
   to make your intentions clear or because there  is  no  default,  your
   terminal makes a warning noise - either a ringing bell or high-pitched
   beep.

   Because the ESC key does not produce a printed character, you  may  be
   unable  to  remember exactly where you pressed it when later examining
   the output from a hard-copy terminal.   If  you  want  to  avoid  this
   possibility,  use  the TERMINAL NO RAISE command to make your terminal
   produce lowercase input, to distinguish it from the uppercase printing
   of the system.

   For TOPS-20 Version 7, recognition has been expanded so that presssing


                                    1-6

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   the  ESC  key  also  shows  as  much  of  a  command  keyword  or file
   specification as possible.  For file specifications, recognition is in
   effect only for the file name, extension, and version.

   You cannot  use  recognition  for  device  names  or  directory  names
   (including file structures), jobnames (for example, with the MODIFY or
   CANCEL command) or logical names.


   §textbf[Abbreviation]

   By abbreviating  commands  and  command  arguments,  you  can  further
   increase  the  speed with which you give instructions to TOPS-20.  The
   smallest unique abbreviation for a command or argument will stand  for
   the  entire  word; if there is a default choice for further arguments,
   the system  will  assume  you  want  this  too.   (You  can  determine
   sufficient   abbreviations  by  using  the  ESC  key:   any  correctly
   recognized abbreviation will stand for the  word.)  For  example,  the
   abbreviated  command  FD stands for the FDIRECTORY command; I L stands
   for INFORMATION LOGICAL-NAMES JOB.

   There are a few cases  where  non-unique  abbreviations  stand  for  a
   frequently  used  command.   For  example, DIS is the abbreviation for
   DISABLE even though two other commands begin with the  letters  DIS  -
   DISCARD and DISMOUNT.

        §uline[Special] §uline[Abbreviation]              §uline[Command]

        C                                 CONTINUE

        D                                 DEPOSIT

        DIS                               DISABLE

        E                                 EXAMINE

        EX                                EXECUTE

        INFORMATION F                     INFORMATION FILE-STATUS

        LOG (When not logged in)          LOGIN

        LOG (When logged in)              LOGOUT

   You cannot use abbreviation (or recognition)  in  a  few  cases.   The
   names of devices (including file structures), and jobnames (given, for
   example, as arguments to the MODIFY or CANCEL command) must  be  typed
   in full; and of course passwords cannot be abbreviated or recognized.

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   §textbf[Question] §textbf[Marks]

   Whenever you type a question mark (?)  instead  of  (or  even  in  the
   middle  of) a TOPS-20 command or command argument, the system responds
   with instructions  or  a  list  of  possible  completions.   By  using
   question  marks  and  recognition  when  you  are unsure of the proper
   command or argument, you can have the  system  help  you  during  your
   terminal session.

   These  features,  together  with  the  HELP  command,  which  provides
   information  on  various  system programs, are valuable supplements to
   the written documentation for TOPS-20.

   For TOPS-20 Version 7, new functionality has been added  to  make  the
   question  mark  feature  more  useful.   More possible completions and
   choices are now listed.  In addition to possible command names  listed
   in  response  to  a  question  mark, the system also displays possible
   filenames from the system (SYS:) directory.  For example:

        @§uline[L] §uline[?] Command, one of the following
           LOAD    LOGOUT
            or system program name
           LOGIN
           LOGOUT


   Where the LOGIN and LOGOUT that appear after "or system program  name"
   are files from the system directory that start with L.

   The functionality of the question mark feature has been  expanded  for
   file  specifications  also.   Question mark lists possible file names,
   extenstions (including nulls), and file version numbers.  For example:

        @§uline[DIRECTORY] §uline[E?] FILE NAME
           EXTRA
           EXTUSR
           EMACS
        @§uline[DIRECTORY] §uline[EMACS.?] FILE NAME
           INIT
           VARS
        @§uline[DIRECTORY] §uline[EMACS.INIT.?] FILE NAME
          1
          2


   §textbf[DATE-TIME] §textbf[ARGUMENTS]

   You can specify date  and  time  arguments  to  many  of  the  TOPS-20
   commands.   The  following  sections  describe  the  formats for these
   arguments.


   §textbf[Date]

                                    1-8

                               §textbf[INTRODUCTION]  


   The examples below show the various formats that  are  acceptable  for
   the date argument:

        Jun 30 1981         30 Jun 1981
        May 1, 82           1/May/1982
        January 000005 75   0005-January-000075
        F/13-83             5/17/83

   If the month and day are both numeric, the first number of the two, if
   less  than  13,  is considered to be the month.  Otherwise, the second
   number is considered to be the month.  For example:

        2/15/83             is February 15th
        15/2/83             is February 15th

   You can abbreviate the month to as few characters as possible  without
   causing it to be confused with another month.  Thus,

        O
        Jun
        Jul
        Ja

   are acceptable abbreviations for October, June, July, and January.

   Many commands allow you to give the day of the week or "today" for the
   date.

   If you specify the time along with the date, you must separate the two
   arguments by at least one space and/or no more than one tab.

   For the time argument you can specify:

        o  time according to a 24-hour clock:

                /AFTER:17:00:00

        o  AM and PM:

                @SET ALERT 5:00PM

        o  the following time zones:

        6:00PM-EDT     is 5:00PM EST
        6:00PM-PST     is 9:00PM EST
        6:00PM-GMT     is 1:00PM EST

   Note that a hyphen (-) is required before the zone.

   The basic time format is:

        hh:mm:ss

   where:

        hh      is hours, must be less than 24, and is optional
        mm      is minutes, must be less than 60, and is required
        ss      is seconds, must be less than 60, and is optional

   The colon between hours and minutes is optional.


   §textbf[Examples] (based on a 24-hour clock):

        3       is 00:03:00AM
        125     is 1:25AM
        14:30   is 2:30PM
        25:33   is 00:25:33AM


   §textbf[Relative] §textbf[Date-Time] §textbf[Arguments]

   Many commands accept relative dates and times.  You can  specify  that
   an  event  is  to  occur  at a certain amount of time from the current
   time, from today, or from a certain day of the  week.   Likewise,  you
   can specify relative times in the past.


   §textbf[Examples]

        @SET ALERT +30      sets an alert for 30 minutes from now

        @DIRECTORY,         produces a listing of files that
        @@BEFORE TODAY      were created before today's date

   §textbf[EXEC] §textbf[MESSAGES]

   The TOPS-20 Command Processor, or EXEC, displays messages in  response
   to  errors  or  other  conditions  that  arise  when using the TOPS-20
   Command Language.  There are three kinds  of  EXEC  messages:   error,
   warning, and information.

   Error messages begin with a  question  mark  (?).   An  error  message
   indicates  that a failure has occurred and execution of the command or
   program has stopped.  If, for example, you type the wrong password  in
   a  LOGIN  or  CONNECT  command,  you  receive  the  message §textbf[?Incorrect]
   §textbf[password], and the command is not executed.

   Warning messages begin with percent sign (%).  A warning message  also
   indicates that a failure has occurred, but execution of the command or
   program usually continues.  For example, suppose you type the  command
   DIRECTORY  *.PAS, *.REL to list all the files with the extensions .PAS
   and .REL, and, your connected directory  does  not  contain  any  .REL
   files.  The EXEC lists all the files with the .PAS extensions and then
   prints the warning message, §textbf[%No] §textbf[such] §textbf[file] §textbf[type] §textbf[*.REL].

   The third type of message you can get from  the  EXEC  (and  sometimes
   from  the system) is an information message.  Information messages are
   enclosed in square brackets §lbrack[] §rbrack[] and inform you about the status of the
   system  or  the  result  of an EXEC command.  For example, the message
   §textbf[§lbrack[]DECSYSTEM-20] §textbf[continued§rbrack[]] indicates that a temporary pause  in  service
   has  ended.   The  message §textbf[§lbrack[]n] §textbf[pages] §textbf[freed§rbrack[]] indicates that your EXPUNGE
   command freed n disk pages.  Usually information messages  require  no
   response from you.

   When you need more information than is provided by  an  EXEC  message,
   see   the   §uline[EXEC]   §uline[Message]  §uline[Manual].   This  manual  contains  detailed
   descriptions of all EXEC messages, plus actions to take for correcting
   errors.


   §textbf[NEW] §textbf[AND] §textbf[CHANGED] §textbf[FEATURES]

   The TOPS-20 EXEC has been enhanced considerably for TOPS-20 Version 7.
   The   following  is  a  list  of  new  commands,  and  new  arguments,
   subcommands and switches to  previously  existing  commands.   Changes
   affecting the command are shown as bulleted items.

                                 CHAPTER 2

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]



   §textbf[2.1]  §textbf[ACCESS]

   Obtains ownership rights to a directory and the group  rights  of  its
   user-group list.


   Format

        @§textbf[ACCESS] (TO DIRECTORY) §textbf[dev:<directory>]
        Password:§textbf[password]

        where:

        dev:<directory>     is the directory that you want to access.
                                 §textbf[Default] dev:  - your connected structure

                                 §textbf[Default] <directory> - the directory  (on
                                                       the      specified
                                                       structure) of  the
                                                       same  name as your
                                                       connected
                                                       directory.

        password            is  the  password  of  the   directory   (not
                            requested  for  your  log-in  directory  or a
                            directory of the same  name  as  your  log-in
                            directory on a domestic structure).


   Characteristics

        Capabilities

             Your capabilities (such as  WHEEL,  OPERATOR,  CONFIDENTIAL)
             are associated with your log-in user name only.  If you give
             the ACCESS command for  a  directory  whose  owner  has  for
             example   WHEEL   capabilities,   you   do  not  gain  these


                                    2-1

                                  §textbf[(ACCESS)]


             capabilities.


   Restrictions

        One Directory Per Structure

             You can access only one directory at a time on each  mounted
             structure.   Each  ACCESS  command  ends any previous ACCESS
             command for that structure (including  the  implicit  access
             obtained  by  the  LOGIN  command).   If  you access another
             directory on the public structure you give up your own group
             rights on the public structure.  These are restored when you
             give an ACCESS command for your log-in directory.

        Not For Files-only Directories

             Because a files-only directory does not  have  an  owner  or
             user group rights, you cannot give an ACCESS command for it.
             Use CONNECT instead.


   Related Commands

        CONNECT             for  making  a   directory   your   connected
                            directory

        END-ACCESS          for  surrendering  rights  to   an   accessed
                            directory

        MOUNT STRUCTURE     for making a structure available for  access,
                            and ensuring the continued availability of an
                            accessed structure


   Examples

        1.  Access another user's directory.

            @§uline[ACCESS] §uline[<HOLLAND>]
            Password:___

        2.  Access another user's directory so you can copy a  file  from
            it to your connected directory.

                                  §textbf[(ADVISE)]


   §textbf[2.2]  §textbf[ADVISE]

   Links your terminal with another user's terminal so that you can  give
   commands  to  that user's job.  The advisee can still give commands to
   his job.


   Format

        @§textbf[ADVISE] (USER) §textbf[argument]

        where:

        argument       is either a user name or terminal line number.


   Characteristics

        Input to Other Job

             For as long as the ADVISE command is in effect, the commands
             you give affect the advisee's job instead of your own.

        Ending Advice

             To end  an  advising  link  that  you  have  formed  between
             terminals,  you must type CTRL/E.  This CTRL/E is not echoed
             on either terminal.

        Refused Advice

             Ordinarily, you cannot advise a job unless its  terminal  is
             set  to  receive  advice.   However,  if  you  have WHEEL or
             OPERATOR capabilities  enabled,  you  can  ADVISE  any  job,
             providing  the  user  has  not  given  the  TERMINAL INHIBIT
             command.

        Special ADVISE Commands

             Once you are advising another  job,  you  can  give  special
             commands  to  send  comments  or  control  characters, or to
             relink to a terminal  that  has  broken  links  with  yours.
             These commands are:

             CTRL/E         End an ADVISE link

             CTRL/~ +       Restart an ADVISE link after a BREAK  command
                            is typed at the advised terminal

             CTRL/~ (       Start a comment (or use the REMARK command)



                                    2-4

                                  §textbf[(ADVISE)]


             CTRL/~ )       End a comment (or use the REMARK command)

             CTRL/~ ?       Display the list of ADVISE control characters

             CTRL/~<CHAR>   Send CTRL/CHAR

                            Note that the tilde character  (~)  can  have
                            different   meanings  with  various  terminal
                            models.  Consult your terminal's  manual  for
                            the character equivalent to 36 octal in ASCII
                            code.


   Special Cases

        Advisee Has More Than One Job

             If more than one job is logged in under the  user  name  you
             specify, the system gives you a list of that user's terminal
             numbers and associated programs to choose from, then  prints
             TTY:  to prompt your response.  Type your choice of terminal
             number after the prompt.

        Advising a Pseudoterminal (PTY:)

             If you try to advise a PTY: the system informs you  of  this
             and asks you to confirm with a carriage return.


   Restrictions

        Compatible Terminals

             Unless the terminals  involved  in  an  advising  link  have
             compatible  characteristics (such as terminal width, ability
             to handle tabs and lowercase letters), some information  can
             be  lost or overprinted.  To avoid this problem, the user of
             the faster  or  more  capable  terminal  should  adjust  his
             terminal's  characteristics,  if  possible before the ADVISE
             command is given.

        Detached Jobs

             You cannot advise detached jobs.


   Warning

        Talking Between a VT100 and a VT52

             If links between VT100 and VT52  terminals  are  established


                                    2-5

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(ADVISE)]


             using  an  ADVISE  (or  TALK) command, the VT52 may function
             improperly during or after the linked interval (for example,
             by  requiring  frequent  CTRL/Q  commands  to print multiple
             lines of output).  Turning the  terminal  off  and  then  on
             again (after the linked interval) will correct this problem.


   Effect on Terminal

        The  ADVISE  command  leaves  your  terminal  at  the   advisee's
        terminal's command level, controlling his job.


   Related Commands

        RECEIVE ADVICE     for allowing other users to advise you

        REFUSE ADVICE      for preventing other users from advising you

        REMARK             for sending comments only

        TALK               for linking terminals so  that  your  commands
                           affect only your own job

        TERMINAL INHIBIT   for   refusing   all   types    of    terminal
                           communication  including advice, links, system

                           mail.


   Examples

        1.  Advise a user, then immediately type CTRL/E to end advice.

                             APPEND Subcommands
         (when used with devices other than the paper tape reader)


        ASCII                    specifies that the files being  appended
                                 are  written  in ASCII mode, with 36-bit
                                 words  each  consisting  of  five  7-bit
                                 bytes  and  a parity bit; the parity bit
                                 means that the least significant bit  is

                                 number).  If you do not  give  the  BYTE

                                 have the same byte size  as  the  source

   Output

        As each file is appended, the system prints its specification and
        the  word  §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[].  Also, if recognition is used on the destination
        file specification, the system prints its status (Old generation,
        New  generation, New file, or Superseding, for disk files; or OK,
        if the files are appended to a non-disk device).


   Characteristics

        Files Appended in Order Specified

             The APPEND command attaches source files to the  destination
             file in the order you specify them; the contents of the last

                                  §textbf[(APPEND)]


             specified source will appear at the end of  the  destination
             file when APPEND is finished.

        Subcommands Optional

             For most purposes you do not need to  use  subcommands  when
             transferring  information  with  the  APPEND command.  These
             subcommands, specifying the format of  the  appended  files,
             are  required  only when using certain devices (for example,
             devices of the form MTn:  (tape drives) using labeled tapes,
             or PTR:  (paper tape reader)) or under particular conditions
             (for  example,  when   transferring   files   over   network
             facilities).   If  you  are  appending information from disk
             files  or  from  your  terminal  and  you  do  not  use  any
             subcommands,  the  data will be appended as written, whether
             in a standard format (usually ASCII or binary) or not.


   Special Cases

        Wildcard Characters

             Wildcard characters (* and %) can be  used  in  source  file
             specifications   only.   The  files  are  then  appended  in
             alphabetical order.

        Appending Information from your Terminal

             If you type TTY:  in place of  source  file  specifications,
             the  system  appends  any  characters  you  then type (after
             completing the command itself), until you give a  CTRL/Z  to
             return  your  terminal  to  TOPS-20  command level.  CTRL/U,
             CTRL/R, CTRL/W, and the Delete key can be used to  edit  the
             current line of terminal input.


   Restrictions

        Source Files With Differing Formats

             You can use the APPEND  command  to  transfer  data  from  a
             magnetic  tape, terminal, card reader, paper tape reader, or
             other device to disk files, but if source files  written  in
             differing  formats  are  specified  within the same command,
             some data can be lost in the transfer.

        Mixing Sequenced and Unsequenced Files

             Source files created by the EDIT program should not  contain
             sequence  numbers when they are appended.  Mixing files that
             contain sequence numbers with files that do not  will  cause

                                  §textbf[(APPEND)]


             EDIT to function improperly if used on the resulting file.

        Appending to Archived Files

             You can append the contents of an archived file  to  another
             file,  by specifying it as the first (or source) argument of
             an APPEND command.  You can then edit  the  resulting  file,
             because it does not gain archive status although part of its
             contents are the same as those of  the  archived  file;  the
             archived  file  remains unchanged.  However, you cannot give
             the specification of an archived  file  as  the  second  (or
             destination)  argument  of  an APPEND command, as this would
             change the file's contents.

        Notice of Archive Sent to Requestor

             Whenever a file is taken  off  line  as  a  result  of  your
             ARCHIVE  command (for example, when you do not also give the
             RETAIN  subcommand),  the  operator  sends  a  mail  message

        Archived Files Unalterable

             You cannot change the contents  of  files  specified  in  an
             ARCHIVE command once the command is given, even if the files
             are not immediately copied to tape.   This  means  that  you
             cannot  alter  or  add  to  them by using the EDIT or APPEND

             The files you  specify  in  an  ARCHIVE  command  ordinarily
             become  invisible  to  most  TOPS-20 commands as soon as the
             ARCHIVE command is  given.   However,  if  you  include  the

   Format

        §textbf[@ASSIGN] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]

        where:

        dev:      is the name of the device  you  want  to  assign.   The
                  colon after the device name is optional.


   Restrictions

        Assigning Magnetic Tape Drives

             You can use the ASSIGN command to assign tape drives only if
             they  are  of the form MTAn:.  Tape device names of the form
             MTn:  are  logical  device  names  only,  and  are  assigned

                                     you give.

        password       is the associated password (not requested  if  you
                       are  currently  logged in under the same user name
                       as the job that you are attaching).


   Characteristics

        Current Job Detached

             If you give the ATTACH command while logged in, your current
             job  is  detached.   You can use the LOGOUT n command to log
             out this detached job.


   Hint

        Using ATTACH to Restore Phoned-in Jobs

             If you log in to the system by telephone lines  and  service
             is  interrupted  for  any  reason, use the ATTACH command to
             restore the connection.  If you do not do  this  within  the
             time limit set by the system manager (usually five minutes),
             your job will be logged out automatically and you will  have
             to log in again.

        Attaching Attached Jobs

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(ATTACH)]


             The system will ask  you  to  confirm  your  choice  with  a
             carriage return before attaching to your terminal a job that
             is attached elsewhere.  If you attach an attached  job  that
             is  running  a program, that program may be sent one or more
             CTRL/Cs,  which  can  affect  programs  that  handle  CTRL/C
             themselves.   To  avoid  this  possibility  you  must give a
             DETACH command from the terminal to which the program's  job
             is  attached,  then attach this job to your terminal with an
             ATTACH command.


   Effect on Memory, Terminal, and Job

        The ATTACH command affects neither memory nor the  job  that  you
        are  attaching (but see Warning, above), and leaves your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level unless a program is  being  run  by  the
        job.  If a program is being run, your terminal is left at command
        level, if any, in the job.  Your terminal's characteristics  will
        be  those  established  in the job from which you gave the ATTACH
        command; if you were not logged in, they will be reset to  system
        default characteristics.

        3.  Check your jobs with the SYSTAT command (your current job  is
            marked  with  an asterisk §lbrack[]*§rbrack[]), then attach the only detached
            job.  Verify the system's action.

                  you  want to move backward.  The colon after the device
                  name is optional.

        n         is the number of files or records over which  you  want
                  to backspace.
                       §textbf[Default] n - 1

        units     is either FILES or RECORDS.
                       §textbf[Default] units - FILES


   Restrictions

        BACKSPACE with Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened a magnetic tape drive and you then give the BACKSPACE
             command for that tape drive, the system will  first  ask  if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             BACKSPACE to succeed, but you will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the  program from that point because the file will
             now be closed.

        RECORDS Argument Used for Unlabeled Tapes Only

             You cannot  give  the  RECORDS  argument  to  the  BACKSPACE
             command  when  using  a labeled tape, because read and write
             operations for labeled tapes always move  the  tape  to  the
             beginning of a file first.

                                 the process by issuing the USER-OF-GROUP
                                 subcommand  for  each subdirectory.  You
                                 can assign up to  40  subdirectory  user
                                 group  numbers  to  each directory, with
                                 values  ranging   from   1   to   262143
                                 (2**18 - 1).

        TOPS10-PROJECT-PROGRAMMER-NUMBER project number, programmer number

                                 allows TOPS-10 programs that  require  a
                                 project-programmer   number   (PPN)   to
                                 create subjobs  to  be  compatible  with
                                 TOPS-20.  The project number is an octal
                                 number  in  the  range  10-377777.   The
                                 programmer  number  is a six-digit octal
                                 number.   Separate  the  project  number
                                 from the programmer number with a comma,
                                 for example 17,76.

        USER-OF-GROUP number     assigns the directory owner to the given
                                 group.   You  can  assign up to 40 group
                                 numbers to each directory,  with  values
                                 ranging  from  1  to 262143 (2**18 - 1).

                                 special  system  directories;  it is not

   Characteristics

        BUILD and ^ECREATE

             The BUILD command is identical in format to  the  privileged
             ^ECREATE  command.   If you use BUILD with WHEEL or OPERATOR
             capabilities enabled, it has the  same  power  as  ^ECREATE,
             namely,  to  create directories and modify the parameters of
             any directory on the system.   Without  these  capabilities,
             you  can  use  BUILD  to  modify  a  more  restricted set of
             directories:  you can modify a directory if you  have  write
             access  to  the  immediately superior directory.  The LOGIN,
             CONNECT, or ACCESS  command  obtains  write  access  to  the
             superior  directory; or, if you have sufficient group rights
             to the superior directory, you can use BUILD to  modify  its
             subdirectories.

        More Information

             For a description of using ^ECREATE to  create  directories,
             see   the  §uline[TOPS-20]  §uline[Operator's]  §uline[Command]  §uline[Language]  §uline[Reference]
             §uline[Manual].

        Quotas Subtracted from the Superior Directory's Allotments

             Working and permanent disk  storage  page  limits,  and  the
             maximum  number  of subdirectories allowed to a subdirectory
             are subtracted from the quotas allocated to the  immediately
             superior  directory.  This subtraction occurs at the time of
             their  allotment  to  a  subdirectory.   If   the   superior
             directory's  quota is not sufficient, the BUILD command will
             fail.  (Note that if you  have  enabled  WHEEL  or  OPERATOR
             capabilities,  you  can  stop the subtraction of quotas from
             the superior directory with the PRESERVE subcommand.)

             To increase the superior directory's quota or any  of  these
             quantities  you  must either kill some of its subdirectories
             or reduce their allotments of the quantity.  Or you can  ask
             the system manager to increase the allotment of the superior
             directory.  Remember that unless  you  specify  working  and


                                    2-36

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]

             permanent  page  limits, they will assume a default value of
             250 pages.  The BUILD command will  fail  in  this  case  if
             there  are  not  at  least 250 pages free in the immediately
             superior directory.

        Assigning Infinite Quotas

             If you have WHEEL or OPERATOR capabilities enabled, you  can
             assign the maximum storage limit of 34359738367 (2**35-1) to
             a directory.   This  will  appear  in  the  response  to  an
             INFORMATION  DIRECTORY  command  as  +INF, denoting infinite
             storage capacity.  If you then  use  the  BUILD  command  to
             construct subdirectories to this directory, any disk storage
             capacity assigned, even the maximum, will not be  subtracted
             from  the  superior  directory.  You can use this feature to
             assign infinite  storage  capacity  to  a  number  of  users
             sharing  a  private  structure.   Then  these  users may use
             storage space on the structure without limit until the  disk
             pack fills up.


   Hints

        Keeping Track of Subdirectories

             Subdirectories appear as files of  type  .DIRECTORY  in  the
             immediately superior directory, so the DIRECTORY *.DIRECTORY
             command  for  the  superior  directory  will  indicate   any
             existing  subdirectories.   To suppress the listing of these
             files you can use the SET FILE PROTECTION  command  to  give
             them  a  protection of 000000, but then you must specify the
             files completely (including  generation  number)  to  access
             them in the future.

             If there are two or more levels of  subdirectories  below  a
             superior  directory,  you  can  do something else to allow a
             listing of them:  put each  subdirectory  into  a  group  of
             which the owner of the highest-level superior directory is a
             member.  Then, if you obtain the group rights of this  owner
             (by  using  the  LOGIN  or  ACCESS  command  if the superior
             directory is on the public structure, or ACCESS if it is  on
             another  structure), the INFORMATION DIRECTORY <directory.*>
             command with the NAME-ONLY subcommand will produce a listing
             of  subdirectories  at  every  level  beneath  the  superior
             directory.  For this feature to operate properly  the  group
             field  of  each  subdirectory's  protection  code must be at
             least 40.

        Modifying Subdirectories Easily

             By  following  the  above  procedure,  that  is,  by  making
             subdirectories at every level members of groups of which the

                                  §textbf[(BUILD)]


             owner of the highest-level  superior  directory  is  also  a
             member,  you  make  the modification of these subdirectories
             much easier.  You can use the BUILD command to modify  these
             subdirectories  or  read  and  write to them, as long as you
             have the group memberships of  this  owner.   You  need  not
             connect  to  each  subdirectory's immediate superior to make
             modifications.


   Restrictions

        Giving Capabilities to Subdirectory Owners

             To  give  capabilities  (WHEEL,   OPERATOR,   SEMI-OPERATOR,
             ABSOLUTE-ARPANET-SOCKETS,    ARPANET-WIZARD,   CONFIDENTIAL,
             ENQ-DEQ, IPCF, or MAINTENANCE) to a subdirectory owner,  you
             must  have  these  capabilities  yourself,  and they must be
             enabled at  the  time  of  the  BUILD  command.   WHEEL  and
             OPERATOR  capabilities allow you to assign any capabilities.
             The INFORMATION DIRECTORY command for your log-in  directory
             tells you which capabilities you have, if any.

        Modifying Other Directories

             Unless you have WHEEL or OPERATOR capabilities enabled,  you
             can  use  the BUILD command to modify the parameters of only
             those directories subordinate to a directory  to  which  you
             have   write   access.    (See  Characteristics - BUILD  and
             ^ECREATE,  and  Hints - Modifying   Subdirectories   Easily,
             above.)  If your installation allows it, you can use the SET
             DIRECTORY  command  to  change  some  parameters  of   these
             directories.

        Files-only Directories

             By giving the FILES-ONLY subcommand you make the directory a
             files-only directory (see Figure 1).  A files-only directory
             is not associated with a user and so  should  not  be  given
             capabilities   or   user   group  memberships.   Although  a
             files-only directory can have subdirectories, none of  these
             can  be  a  user  directory.   You cannot give the ACCESS or
             LOGIN command for a files-only directory.

        Killing Directories

             You cannot kill a directory that has  subdirectories;  first
             you  must  kill  those subdirectories one by one.  (When you
             kill a directory, the files  it  contains  are  deleted  and
             expunged.)  Also,  you  cannot  kill  a directory if you are
             logged into it or connected to it, or there are  open  files
             on it.

   Output

        When you complete a CANCEL command removing a request, the system
        responds  with  "§lbrack[]1  Job  Canceled§rbrack[]"  and  makes  the appropriate
        deletion  from  the  indicated  queue.   If  the  job  is   being
        processed,   the   response   is  "§lbrack[]1  Job  Canceled  (1  was  in
        progress)§rbrack[]", but if the job is already  finished,  it  is  simply
        "§lbrack[]No Jobs Killed§rbrack[]".


   Characteristics

        Request ID or Jobname as Argument to CANCEL

             You can cancel a  single  queue  request  (those  made  with
             Queue-class  commands - MOUNT, PLOT, PRINT, PUNCH, RETRIEVE,
             or SUBMIT) by giving either its request  ID  number  or  its
             jobname  as  the  second argument of a CANCEL command.  This

                                  §textbf[(CANCEL)]


             argument is interpreted as a request  ID  number  unless  it
             includes   one  or  more  non-numeric  characters.   If  the
             argument includes non-numeric characters it  is  interpreted
             as a jobname.  By giving a jobname as the second argument of
             a CANCEL command, you  cancel  all  your  requests  of  that
             jobname  in  the  specified  queue.   But  see  also Special
             Cases -  /JOBNAME Switch, below.


   Special Cases

        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch, /SPOOLED-OUTPUT, after  the
             CARDS,  PAPER-TAPE,  PLOT,  or  PRINT argument to the CANCEL
             command.  By doing so you cause any accumulated requests  in
             the  spooler  queue for the appropriate output device (CDP:,
             PTP:, PLT:, or LPT:, respectively) to  be  canceled,  rather
             than  filled  when  you  log  out.   Do not give any further
             arguments to a "CANCEL queue /SPOOLED-OUTPUT" command.

             If any spooled file print requests have  been  routed  to  a
             remote  node,  use  the  /DESTINATION-NODE  switch to cancel
             them.

        /JOBNAME Switch

             In the singular case when you want to cancel  several  queue
             requests  of  the  same  jobname using a single command, and
             that jobname is purely numerical (for  example,  5045),  you
             must  use the /JOBNAME:jobname switch as the second argument
             to the CANCEL command.  Do not also give the request  ID  or
             jobname   as   a   command   argument   if   you   give  the
             /JOBNAME:jobname switch.


   Restrictions

        Cannot Cancel Filled Tape-mount Requests

             You cannot use the CANCEL command to withdraw a  MOUNT  TAPE
             request once the first volume of tape has been mounted (once
             you have received a message of the form, §lbrack[]setname defined as
             MTn:§rbrack[]).   Use  the  DISMOUNT  command  to  give up your tape
             resource in this case.  Note that  the  DEASSIGN  or  LOGOUT
             command will also dismount the tape set.

        Cannot Cancel Certain Archival Requests

             You cannot use the CANCEL command to  withdraw  an  archival
             request once the operator has initiated archival procedures.
             Thus,  even  though  files  remain  on  disk   between   the

             operator's  first and second archive runs, you cannot cancel
             a request during this time.  If you try to cancel a  request
             after archiving has begun, you receive the error message:

                  ?File has archive status:  filename

             Note that this error does not terminate a  multifile  CANCEL
             ARCHIVE  command  (for  example,  CANCEL  ARCHIVE  *.*); the
             TOPS-20  command   processor   continues   processing   each
             remaining  filename  in  the  request.   Cancel requests for
             these remaining files are judged individually.

   §textbf[2.12]  §textbf[CLOSE]

   Closes open files in your job and releases their JFNs.


   Format

        @§textbf[CLOSE] (JFN) §textbf[n]

        where:

        n    is the JFN (Job File Number) of a file.
                  §textbf[Default] n - all JFNs for open and closed files


   Output

        When the CLOSE command is completed, the system prints a  message
        on  your terminal for each JFN that it has closed or attempted to
        close.


   Characteristics

        CLOSE Usually Unnecessary

             The CLOSE command is used to preserve the contents of a file
             after  the  abnormal  termination of the program that opened
             it.  Under ordinary conditions you do not need  to  use  the
             CLOSE command.


   Special Cases

        CLOSE For Closed Files

             If you give the CLOSE command for  an  existing  but  closed
             JFN, the JFN is released.


   Restrictions

        Closing Mapped Files

             You cannot close files that are mapped into memory; in  this
             case  you  may  give the RESET command, which clears memory.
             (Note, however, that RESET will delete and expunge a  mapped
             file if the file is new, rather than save it as CLOSE would.
             To save a new mapped file, give the  SET  PAGE-ACCESS  0:777
             NONEXISTENT  command, and follow this with CLOSE.)  If RESET
             by itself does not close the file, you  may  first  have  to

                                  §textbf[(CLOSE)]


             give  the  POP  command  to  return to a higher level of the
             TOPS-20 command processor; then give the RESET command.

        Once memory has been cleared, all files are closed for  processes
        at the current and lower levels of TOPS-20.

        RESET                       for closing mapped files and clearing

        2.  Try to close all your open files.  Give the RESET command  to
            close  those  that are mapped.  (Note that the file EXEC.EXE,

        Descriptions of these switches are  given  below.   Although  the
        system  will  not  reject  switches  described  under  any of the
        LOAD-class commands, only those switches commonly associated with
        COMPILE are described here.


                            COMPILE Command Switches


        /10-BLISS      compiles the file using the BLISS-10 compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .B10 and .BLI

        /36-BLISS      compiles the file using the BLISS-36 compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .B36

        /68-COBOL      compiles the file using the COBOL-68 compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .C68 or .68C

        /74-COBOL      compiles the file using the COBOL-74 compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .C74 or .74C

                                 §textbf[(COMPILE)]


        /ABORT         stops a compile if a fatal error is  detected  and
                       returns your terminal to TOPS-20 command level.

        /ALGOL         compiles the file using the ALGOL compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .ALG

        /BINARY        allows generation of an object (binary)  file  for
                       each source file given.  Use this switch to cancel
                       a /NOBINARY switch.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /COBOL         compiles the file using the COBOL compiler, either
                       COBOL-68  or  COBOL-74, that your installation has
                       stored in the file SYS:COBOL.EXE.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .CBL

        /COMPILE       forces compilation of the source file  even  if  a
                       current  object  file  already  exists.   Use this
                       switch along with the /LIST  or  /CREF  switch  to
                       obtain  listings  when  you  have  current  object
                       files.  (See also the /NOBINARY switch.)

        /CREF          same as /CROSS-REFERENCE

        /CROSS-REFERENCE
                       creates   a   file   containing    cross-reference
                       information for each compilation.  The filename is
                       that of the object file; the file  type  is  .CRF.
                       Use  the  CREF  command to obtain a listing of the
                       file.  (For COBOL files, this switch automatically
                       produces  a  cross-reference  listing.)   See  the
                       §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User] §uline[Utilities] §uline[Guide] for information about
                       the CREF program.

        /DDT           loads the DDT debugging program  along  with  your
                       object file.

        /DEBUG         produces  an  object  file  containing   debugging
                       information beyond what is usually inserted during
                       a compilation.  (For FORTRAN  programs  only,  and
                       only if you have not given the /OPTIMIZE switch.)

        /FAIL          compiles the file using the FAIL compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .FAI

        /FLAG-NON-STANDARD
                       indicates non-standard syntax in file.

        /FORTRAN       compiles the file using the FORTRAN compiler
                            §textbf[Default]  in the absence of a standard  source
                                     file type and a language switch

                            §textbf[Default]  for files of type .FOR

        /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES:"/switch(es)"
                       passes the specified switches to the compiler that
                       will  process  the  file(s)  to  which this switch
                       applies.  You must include the switches in  double
                       quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIBRARY       same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST          prints a listing of the program in  ASCII  format;
                       the  name  of  this listing is the filename of the
                       object file.  The  /CREF  switch  overrides  /LIST
                       when they both apply to the same file.

        /MAC           same as /MACRO

        /MACHINE-CODE  produces a file containing the  generated  machine
                       code.   The  filename  is that of the object file;
                       the file type is .LST.  For high-level languages.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /MACRO         assembles the file using the MACRO assembler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .MAC

        /MAP           produces a loader map and stores it  in  the  file
                       object.MAP, where object is the name of the module
                       containing the start  address,  or  (if  no  start
                       address) nnnLNK.MAP, where nnn is your job number.

        /NOBINARY      prevents generation of an  object  (binary)  file.
                       Use this switch along with /LIST or /CREF to allow
                       these switches to take effect without producing  a
                       new object file.

        /NOCREF        same as /NOCROSS-REFERENCE.

        /NOCOMPILE     prevents compilation if the associated object file
                       is   current;  otherwise  it  forces  compilation.
                       Cancels    /COMPILE    or    /RELOCATABLE.     See
                       Characteristics - Compiling   New   Sources  Only,
                       below.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOCROSS-REFERENCE
                       prevents the creation of a cross-reference file.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NODEBUG       excludes special debugging information  from  your
                       object file.  (For FORTRAN programs only.)

                       file.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOLIBRARY     same as /NOSEARCH.

        /NOLIST        prevents a line printer listing of the program.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOMACHINE-CODE
                       prevents generation of a file  containing  machine
                       code.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOOPTIMIZE    prevents the generation of  a  globally  optimized
                       object file.  (For FORTRAN programs only.)
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOSEARCH      requires all modules in the  object  file  library
                       (the  file  accompanied  by  this  switch  in  the
                       command line) to be loaded, even if they  are  not
                       called  by  your  program.   Cancels  the  /SEARCH
                       switch.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /NOSTAY        stops  the  compiler  from  being  placed   in   a
                       background  fork.   Use  when  /STAY  is  set as a
                       default for the compiler.

        /NOSYMBOLS     prevents a symbol table from  being  loaded  along
                       with the object file.

        /NOWARNINGS    prevents display of warnings for nonfatal errors.

        /OPTIMIZE      calls  for  generation  of  a  globally  optimized
                       object  file, that is, one that runs as quickly as
                       possible.  (For FORTRAN programs only, and only if
                       you have not given the /DEBUG switch.)

        /PASCAL        compiles the file using the PASCAL compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .PAS

        /RELOCATABLE   identifies  the  input  file  as  an  object  file
                       (regardless   of   its   extension)  and  prevents
                       compilation of the source file, forcing use of  an
                       existing  object  file  even if the object file is
                       out of date.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .REL

        /SAIL          compiles the file using the SAIL compiler.

                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .SAI

        /SEARCH        requires that the object file  library  (the  file
                       accompanied by this switch in the command line) be
                       searched for modules called by your program or  by
                       a  program  subroutine.   Only  these  modules are
                       loaded, along with modules called from the  system
                       libraries, which are always searched.

        /SIMULA        compiles the file using the SIMULA compiler.
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .SIM

        /SNOBOL        compiles the file using the SNOBOL compiler
                            §textbf[Default] for files of type .SNO

        /STAY          returns your terminal to TOPS-20 command level  so
                       that  you  can perform other work while the system
                       continues   to   compile   your   program.     You
                       immediately  receive  the TOPS-20 prompt (@ or $),
                       and can then issue any user command.   Be  careful
                       not  to  send incorrect data to programs expecting
                       terminal  input.   (See  the   CONTINUE   command,
                       Restrictions:   Programs  Competing  for  Terminal
                       Input.)

                       This switch saves you from having to:  issue a  ^T
                       to  make sure the compiler has begun; give a ^C to
                       halt  compilation;  and  issue  a  CONTINUE  /STAY
                       command   to   remain   at  command  level  during
                       compilation.

        /SYMBOLS       loads a symbol table along with the  object  file;

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             The system usually compiles only  those  sources  for  which
             there  are  no  current object files, that is, sources whose
             write dates are more recent than those of the  object  files
             of the same name.

             However, sources for which you supply a new object  filename
             are  compiled  even  if there are current object files.  You
             can always force compilation with the /COMPILE switch.

                                 §textbf[(COMPILE)]


        Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler

             Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
             to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
             the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
             the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.

        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL,   or   .ALG)   in   a   COMPILE  command,  the  system
             automatically   calls   the   appropriate   compiler    when
             compilation  is  necessary.   If you specify source files by
             filename only, the system searches your connected  directory
             in  the  above  order for a file of this name and a standard
             type.   To  compile  programs   from   sources   that   have
             nonstandard file types, give a switch to indicate the proper
             compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or  /ALGOL).   A  switch
             will  take  precedence  over  a  standard  file type if they
             indicate different languages.  If no compiler  is  indicated
             with  either  a  switch or a standard file type, the FORTRAN
             compiler is used.


   Hints

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+)  as  arguments to COMPILE, they are compiled together as
             if they were a single file.  Their object module  is  stored
             under  any  filename  given  as the "object" argument of the
             command, or (if none) under the last filename in  the  group
             and file type .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  a  COMPILE  command  in an indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as  a
             COMPILE command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to the COMPILE command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.

        Wildcards Illegal with COMPILE

                                 §textbf[(COMPILE)]


             The COMPILE command does not accept wildcard  characters  (*
             and %) in a file specification.


   Effect on Memory

        The COMPILE command clears any unkept forks from memory and loads
        the appropriate compiler.


   Related Commands

        LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG     other   LOAD-class   commands    for
                                     performing related functions


   Examples

        1.  Compile a FORTRAN program.

            @§uline[COMPILE] §uline[RSD2.FOR]
            FORTRAN: RSD2
            MAIN.

        2.  Do the same thing, using a  switch  to  indicate  the  proper
            compiler.   Use  the  /STAY  switch  to return immediately to
            TOPS-20 command level.

            @§uline[COMPILE] §uline[RSD2/FORTRAN/STAY]
            @§uline[PUSH]

             TOPS-20 Command processor 7(1015)
            @§uline[EDIT] §uline[LOGIN.CMD]

        3.  Create an indirect file using the EDIT  editor.   Use  it  to
            compile  several  programs, forcing a compilation of the last
            one and storing its object file under a new name.

   §textbf[2.14]  §textbf[CONNECT]

   Connects your job to a directory.


   Format

        @§textbf[CONNECT] (TO DIRECTORY) §textbf[dev:<directory>]
        PASSWORD:§textbf[password]

        where:

        dev:<directory>     is  the  directory  to  which  you  want   to
                            connect.

                                 §textbf[Default] dev: - your connected structure

                                 §textbf[Default] <directory> - the directory  (on
                                         the  specified structure) of the
                                         same  name  as  your   connected
                                         directory

                                 §textbf[Default] (if no arguments  are  given)  -

                            or sufficient group rights).


   Characteristics

        Capabilities

             Your   capabilities   (WHEEL,    OPERATOR,    SEMI-OPERATOR,
             CONFIDENTIAL)  are  associated  with  your  log-in user name
             only.  If you connect to a directory whose owner  has  Wheel
             capabilities, you do not gain these capabilities.


   Hints

        Obtaining Group Rights

             You can obtain group rights equal to those of the owner of a
             directory  by  giving  the  ACCESS command instead of, or in
             addition to, CONNECT for that directory.

   Restrictions

        Features Not Affected

             For some  system  features,  CONNECT  does  not  affect  the
             directory used:

        System Accounting

             The SET ACCOUNT command  allows  arguments  valid  for  your
             log-in  user  name  only.  Generally, charges for system use
             are made to your log-in user name.

        Queue-class Commands

             The Queue-class commands charge processing requests to  your
             log-in user name only.


   Related Commands

        ACCESS     for obtaining group as well as ownership rights  equal

   §textbf[2.15]  §textbf[CONTINUE]

   Continues execution of a fork that was halted.


   Format

        @§textbf[CONTINUE] (FORK) §textbf[argument] §textbf[/switch]

        where:

        argument       is the fork name or fork number.
                            §textbf[Default] - the current fork

        /switch        is  a  keyword,  chosen  from  the   list   below,
                       indicating   your   choice   of  CONTINUE  command
                       options.


                         CONTINUE Command Switches


        /BACKGROUND    keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command  level  and
                       continues   execution   of   the   program   in  a
                       "background" fork.  When the program  attempts  to
                       do terminal input or output, it halts and displays
                       the message §lbrack[]FORK-NAME wants the TTY§rbrack[].

        /NORMALLY      restores your terminal to command level  (if  any)
                       within the program.
                            §textbf[Default]

        /STAY          keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command  level  and
                       continues   execution   of   the   program   in  a
                       "background" fork.  Output  from  the  program  is
                       sent  to  the  terminal  and  is  intermixed  with
                       whatever output is currently displayed.  When  the
                       program attempts to read from the terminal, it can
                       randomly intercept input intended for the EXEC  or
                       another  program.  Therefore, use this switch with
                       programs  that,  once  started,  do  not   request
                       further terminal input.


   Characteristics

        Continuing a Noncurrent Fork

             When you  continue  a  noncurrent  fork,  by  including  the
             fork-name argument in a CONTINUE command, the specified fork
             becomes your current fork.

                                 §textbf[(CONTINUE)]


   Hints

        Stopping a Background Program

             To stop a background program, give the FREEZE command.

        Providing Input to a Background Program

             A background program, continued with  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND,
             sends  the  message  §lbrack[]FORK-NAME wants the TTY§rbrack[] when it wants
             input.  A background program, continued with CONTINUE /STAY,
             prints  the  program  prompt,  for  example PASCAL>, when it
             wants input.  To (provide input to a program that is running
             in  a  background fork, return to program command level with
             CONTINUE /NORMALLY.  (Some programs require you to  type  an
             extra RETURN after CONTINUE /NORMALLY to display the program
             prompt).  Then,  type  the  required  program  input.   (See
             below, Restrictions, Programs Competing for Terminal Input.)

        Monitoring your Program

             CONTINUE /STAY and CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND,  by  keeping  your
             terminal  at  TOPS-20  command  level  (EXEC),  let  you use
             TOPS-20 commands to monitor the  progress  of  your  program
             while  it  is  running.   Use  the  INFORMATION  FORK-STATUS
             command to display the CPU time used and the  kept  and  RUN
             status  of  each  fork  belonging to the current EXEC level.
             More commands for monitoring your programs are listed  below
             in Related Commands.

        Running Multiple Programs Simultaneously

             To simultaneously run multiple programs in background  forks
             or use commands that affect memory, use one or a combination
             of the  following  methods  after  placing  a  fork  in  the
             background with CONTINUE /STAY or CONTINUE /BACKGROUND:

             PUSHing to an Inferior EXEC Level

                  Type the PUSH command to create an inferior EXEC  level
                  and  a  fresh copy of memory (address space).  Then run
                  another program and return to EXEC command  level  with
                  CONTINUE   /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND.   The  new
                  program does not affect the  background  program  since
                  both  programs are at a different EXEC level.  However,
                  see Restrictions below.  PUSH  to  a  new  EXEC  before
                  running each new program.

             KEEPing the Fork

                  Type the KEEP command to give  the  background  fork  a


                                    2-66

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                 §textbf[(CONTINUE)]


                  "kept" status.  (A kept fork is not cleared from memory
                  when another  program  is  loaded.)  Then  run  another
                  program  and return to EXEC command level with CONTINUE
                  /STAY or CONTINUE /BACKGROUND.   KEEP  each  background
                  fork  before running another program.  Check the status
                  of your forks with INFORMATION FORK-STATUS.

        Continuing Forks Using the Fork Name

             You can continue a fork by typing the fork  name  as  if  it
             were  the  CONTINUE  command.   To  function as the CONTINUE
             command, the fork must be "kept" with the KEEP  or  the  SET
             PROGRAM  KEEP  command.   For more information, refer to the
             descriptions of these commands.

        More Information

             The   CONTINUE   command   is    one    of    the    TOPS-20
             multiforking-class  commands.   For  more  information about
             multiforking,  see  the  section  named,  Running   Multiple
             Programs, in the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].


   Restrictions

        Similar Programs Competing for Files

             If you have two  similar  programs  running  simultaneously,
             they  may try to access the same files at the same time (for
             example, temporary files labeled  by  job  number,  used  by
             compilers).   This  may  cause  unpredictable  situations to
             develop.  To avoid the possibility, run different  kinds  of
             programs.

        Programs Competing for Terminal Input

             If you use CONTINUE /STAY to run a program in  a  background
             fork,  the program can request input from the terminal while
             you are giving input to the EXEC or another  program.   This
             input  can be randomly intercepted by the background program
             when it requests terminal input.  Usually though,  the  EXEC
             or the current program receives the input.

             When  terminal  input  is  intercepted  by  the   background
             program, the program will usually type input error messages.
             To give input to the program, stop the program by typing two
             CTRL/Cs  or  the  program's  exit  command.   Then,  if  the
             background program is at a higher EXEC command  level,  give
             POP  commands  to  return  to  the EXEC level that holds the
             background program.  (POP terminates the  current  EXEC  and
             erases  programs  in its memory.) Finally, give the CONTINUE


                                    2-67

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                 §textbf[(CONTINUE)]


             /NORMALLY command; this puts you at program command level so
             that you can give the requested input.

             Remember, input is intercepted  by  the  background  program
             randomly.   Therefore,  you  may have to type extra CTRL/Cs,
             program exit commands, and POPs.  To reduce confusion  about
             the  direction of terminal input, it is recommended that you
             use CONTINUE /STAY only when you plan to work at the current
             EXEC  level  while a program runs in a background fork.  You
             should also CONTINUE /STAY programs that simply end  without
             requesting  terminal  input.   Use CONTINUE /BACKGROUND when
             you plan to work at a lower EXEC level or at another program
             command level.

             When a program started with  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND  requests
             terminal  input,  it sends the message, §lbrack[]FORK-NAME wants the
             TTY§rbrack[].  No input is taken by the background program until you
             return  to  program  command  level with CONTINUE /NORMALLY.
             You  should  CONTINUE /BACKGROUND  programs   that   request
             terminal input.

        Maintaining Access to Directories

             While a fork is running in the background,  use  caution  in
             using the CONNECT, ACCESS and END-ACCESS commands.  Changing
             your  directory  access  could  leave  the  fork  unable  to
             reference certain files.

        No I/O Control with Some Programs

             Most programs read and write data to  the  terminal  through
             standard   input  and  output  designators.   Some  programs
             however, use different methods  of  communicating  with  the
             terminal.   Therefore, when you use /BACKGROUND and /STAY to
             control terminal input and output from  a  background  fork,
             the  input  and output behavior of programs with nonstandard
             designators can be unpredictable.

        Continued Programs Do Not Prompt for input

             When you continue a  program,  the  program  continues  from
             exactly  where  it  was  interrupted.   If  the  program was
             waiting for input, it  will  simply  continue  to  wait  for
             input;  it  won't prompt you again.  For example, assume you
             are running the DECmail/MS program and you press  CTRL/C  at
             the MS> prompt.  Next, you CONTINUE MS.  The cursor moves to
             the next line but no MS> prompt appears.  This is because MS
             has  continued  to  do  the last thing it was doing when you
             interrrupted it with CTRL/C - waiting for a command  at  the
             MS>  prompt.   MS does not know that its prompt is no longer
             displayed before the cursor.

                                 §textbf[(CONTINUE)]


             So,  when  you  continue  a  program  and  nothing  happens,
             consider  what you were doing when you CTRL/C'd the program.
             If you were at the MS> prompt, type an MS command or,  press
             RETURN  again to redisplay the MS> prompt.  If you had typed
             a portion of and MS command, press CTRL/R to  redisplay  the
             command.   If  you  had  typed  a portion of a mail message,
             press CTRL/K to redisplay the message.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The CONTINUE /NORMALLY command resumes processing the program  in
        memory,  and  leaves  your  terminal at program command level (if
        any).  The  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND  and  CONTINUE  /STAY  commands
        resume  processing the program in memory, but leave your terminal
        at TOPS-20 command level.

        2.  Run the DSR program and then halt it by typing  two  CTRL/Cs.
            Give  the  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND command to continue DSR in a

            Now begin editing a file with the EDIT program.  During  your
            editing  session  the system notifies you that the background
            fork wants input.  To return to DSR command level, first exit
            the  edit  program.   Then  check  the  fork  status with the

   Output

        As each file is copied, the system prints the  specifications  of
        the  source  and  destination files and the word §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[].  The delay
        before you see this §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[] indicates how long it took to  copy  the
        file.    If   you   use   recognition  on  the  destination  file
        specification, the system prints, !New Generation!,  !New  File!,
        or  !Superseding!, to indicate the status of disk files, or !OK!,
        if the file is copied to a non-disk device.


   Characteristics

        Optional Subcommands With Paper Tape

             Each subcommand, when used  to  copy  information  from  the
             paper  tape  reader  (PTR:),  specifies an interpretation of
             eight-bit bytes, represented as eight-hole  lines  on  paper
             tape.   When  used  with  the  paper tape punch (PTP:), each
             subcommand  specifies  a  mapping  of  information  to   the
             eight-bit bytes of paper tape.

        Optional Subcommands With Other Devices

             Each subcommand can be used under particular conditions, for
             example,  when  transferring  files  over network facilities
             (using  DCN:   and  SRV:),to  specify  the  byte   size   of
             information  being  copied.   In  general,  you can use COPY
             command subcommands whenever you need to  specify  the  byte
             size of information being copied.

   Hints

        RENAME Faster Than COPY for Transferring Files

             For moving a set of files from one directory to  another  on
             the  same structure, the RENAME command is a faster and more
             efficient means than COPY.   This  is  because  RENAME  only
             changes  the  file  specifications;  it  does  not  copy the
             contents of the files.   Also,  a  file  transfer  with  the
             RENAME  command  leaves  only  one  set  of  files,  while a
             transfer  with  the  COPY  command  leaves  two  sets:   the
             original  copies  and  the destination copies.  The original
             copies are often unnecessary and must be deleted.

        Using Devices as Source and/or Destination Filespecs

             By specifying a device  as  the  source  and/or  destination
             filespec,   you   can  use  the  COPY  command  to  transfer
             information between card-  or  paper-tape-handling  devices,
             magnetic  tape  drives,  line  printers, terminals, or other
             output devices.  However, the PLOT, PRINT,  PUNCH  and  TYPE
             commands,  and  appropriate utility programs (such as DUMPER
             and EDIT), offer more flexibility for most applications.

             Copying To or From TTY:

                  You can simulate the action of the CREATE  command  for
                  creating  files  by  copying from device TTY:  to a new
                  filespec, ending your input with a CTRL/Z; use  CTRL/U,
                  CTRL/R,  CTRL/W, and the DELETE key to edit the current
                  line of terminal input.  You can simulate the action of
                  the  TYPE  command for displaying files by copying from
                  an existing filespec to device TTY:.

             Viewing Display Screen Data

                  If you specify TTY:  as the  destination  filespec  and
                  then  give  the  BYTE  8  subcommand, characters in the
                  source file will be sent literally  to  your  terminal.
                  Do  this  to  examine  special display screen data (for
                  8-bit ASCII files only).

             Erasing the Contents of a File While Keeping the Filespec

                  You can erase the contents of a file  by  copying  from
                  device  NUL:   to  the file.  NUL:  is a receptacle for
                  unwanted program output and a supplier of null input.

             Spooled Output Action

                  If you send information to  output  devices  using  the

                                   §textbf[(COPY)]


                  COPY  command,  your  request is processed according to
                  the  status  of  the  SPOOLED-OUTPUT-ACTION  parameter,
                  which   you  set  with  the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT-ACTION
                  command.

             Using Wildcards in Source and/or Destination Filespecs

                  You can use wildcard characters (*  and  %)  in  source
                  and/or  destination  filespecs  to copy many files at a
                  time.  Default values  will  be  assumed  for  filespec
                  fields  you  do  not  specify.   Note  that  if you use
                  wildcard characters to copy more than one  source  file
                  into a single destination file on disk, the contents of
                  each source file will appear in a different  generation
                  of  the  destination  file; the highest generation will
                  contain a copy of the last source file only.   Use  the
                  APPEND  command  to  put  the contents of several files
                  into a single file.

             Specifying a New Account or Protection Number

                  The COPY  command  lets  you  specify  the  new  file's
                  protection  number,  and  the  account to which storage
                  fees for it will  be  charged.   Follow  the  new  file
                  specification  with  a  semicolon  (;) and the letter P
                  before giving a new 6-digit protection number, and with
                  a  semicolon  and  the  letter  A  before  giving a new
                  account (which must be valid for your user  name).   If
                  you  do  not specify an account for a new file, it will
                  take as a default the account you  gave  in  your  most
                  recent   LOGIN   or   SET  ACCOUNT  command.   However,
                  non-default protection numbers will be  maintained  for
                  higher   generations  of  existing  files,  unless  you
                  specify otherwise in the COPY command that creates that
                  higher generation.


   Restrictions

        Copying Archived Files

             You can make a copy of an archived file by specifying it  as
             the  first  (or  source)  argument  in  a  COPY command, and
             specifying a file of different name or type as  destination.
             You  can edit the new file, because it does not have archive
             status although it has the same  contents  as  the  original
             file.   However,  you  cannot  give  the specification of an
             archived file as the second (or destination) argument  of  a
             COPY command, as this would replace the file's contents.  If
             you attempt to do so, whatever source  argument  you  supply
             will  be  copied  into  the  next  higher  generation of the

             archived file, leaving the archived file  intact.   And,  if
             you   include  the  generation  number  when  specifying  an
             archived file as the second argument of a COPY command,  the
             command will fail.


   Warning

        Destroying the Previous Contents of Files

             If you give a destination file specification that includes a
             generation  number, the source file will be copied into that
             file, replacing any previous contents if that generation  of
             the   file   already   exists.   Those  contents  cannot  be
             recovered.  But see Restrictions - Copying  Archived  Files,
             above.

   Characteristics

        Input Mode and Edit Mode

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(CREATE)]


             The CREATE command runs the EDIT system  program,  first  in
             Input  mode  and  then  in  Edit  mode.   (However, see also
             Special Cases, below.) Input mode automatically begins  each
             line with a line number (unless you have given the /NONUMBER
             switch), and allows you to put  any  alphabetic  or  numeric
             information  into  the  file.   When you have finished doing
             this and press the ESCAPE key, the  EDIT  program  puts  you
             into Edit mode and prompts you with an asterisk (*), just as
             if you had typed the EDIT command with the specifications of
             the newly-created file as argument.  If you want to save the
             file in its present state, give the E (for end)  command  to
             the  EDIT  program.   Otherwise, you can give any other EDIT
             command to change or add to the file before saving it.


   Hints

        Saving Backup Files Periodically

             Give the /ISAVE:n switch to save an updated copy of the file
             you  are  creating  after  every n lines inserted.  Then you
             will lose only a few lines of input in the event of a system
             failure.   The  similar  /SAVE:n  switch  is  useful for the
             CREATE command only in Edit mode, where it saves an  updated
             copy  of  the  file after every n EDIT program commands that
             modify the file.

        SWITCH.INI File

             If there is a group of  CREATE  command  switches  that  you
             always  or  often use with CREATE or EDIT commands, put them
             into a file  of  specification  SWITCH.INI  in  your  log-in
             directory,  in  a line of that file beginning with EDIT:abc,
             where abc is any set of characters you  choose  to  identify
             the line.  Then if you include the single switch /OPTION:abc
             when you give a CREATE or EDIT command, all  these  switches
             will be in effect.

        Further Information

             For more information about the EDIT program, see the §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[EDIT] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].


   Special Cases

        Using an Editor Other than EDIT

             The CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE command  descriptions  in  this
             manual  assume  that these commands call on the EDIT program
             for their action.  If your job uses another editing program,


                                    2-84

                                  §textbf[(CREATE)]


             for  example  EDT, the switches and examples shown here will
             not be applicable.

             The editor used by CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE is specified  by
             logical  name  EDITOR:, so you can find out the name of this
             program by giving  the  command,  INFORMATION  LOGICAL-NAMES
             EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition  (if any) will be given
             first, followed by the system-wide definition; the  job-wide
             definition  prevails  if  both  exist.  If the definition of
             EDITOR:   is  SYS:EDIT.EXE,  the  CREATE,  EDIT  and  PERUSE
             commands   will   function  as  described  in  this  manual.
             Otherwise, you must  consult  the  appropriate  manual  (for
             example, the §uline[EDT-20] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual]) for information.

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  define  logical  name
             EDITOR:   to  be  any  editing  program  available  at  your
             installation.  Then this editor will be in effect  when  you
             give the CREATE or EDIT command.


   Effect on Memory

        The CREATE command clears any  unkept  forks  from  memory,  then
        loads the editor program defined by the logical name EDITOR.

        /O             Includes the Op Code Table in the CREF listing.

        /P             Preserves an input file with the file type .CRF or
                       .LST.   These  types  of  input files are normally
                       deleted.

        /R             Requests the line number at which the CREF listing
                       is  to  start.  CREF types out "RESTART LISTING AT
                       LINE:", after which you type the line  number  and
                       press  RETURN.   If you use an indirect file, CREF
                       looks for the number in the indirect file.  /R  is
                       most   useful   for  physical  (non-spooled)  line
                       printers, and is illegal in a SWITCH.INI file.

        /S             Suppresses the program listing and lists only  the
                       tables you select.

        /T             Skips to the logical end of the magnetic tape.

        /W             Rewinds the magnetic tape.

        /Z             Zeroes  the  DECtape   directory.    This   is   a
                       historical switch, and is illegal.


   Characteristics

        Current .CRF Files

             If you have  files  of  type  .CRF  produced  by  LOAD-class
             commands during the current terminal session, the unmodified
             command CREF produces  listings  of  them  and  deletes  the
             files.   By  supplying  an argument of the form shown in the
             Format section above, you can copy the listing for a current
             .CRF  file  to  another  file  or  device.   To run the CREF
             program yourself when you have current .CRF files, give  the
             command R CREF instead.

        .CRF Files From a Previous Session

             If your only files of type .CRF (created by the CREF program
             or  one  of  the LOAD-class commands) were produced during a
             previous  terminal  session,  the  command  CREF  puts  your
             terminal at command level in the CREF program, symbolized by
             an asterisk (*).  Thus it is equivalent  to  the  command  R
             CREF  in this case.  See Hints - Further Information, below,
             for advice on how to proceed.

   Hints

        Producing .CRF Files

             You can produce cross-reference files by including the /CREF
             switch  in  any  LOAD-class  command  that actually causes a
             compilation (i.e., is not  prevented  from  doing  so  by  a
             /RELOCATABLE  switch  or  by the existence of current object
             files).

        Preserving .CRF Files After Processing

             Give the /P switch immediately after  the  CREF  command  to
             preserve  .CRF  files.   Ordinarily  they  are deleted after
             being sent to an output device or copied into another file.

        Further Information

             For a brief on-line description of the  CREF  program,  give
             the  HELP  CREF command.  For more detailed information, see
             the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User] §uline[Utilities] §uline[Guide].


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The CREF command replaces the contents of  any  unkept  forks  in
        memory  with the CREF program and leaves your terminal at TOPS-20
        command level, or at command level within  CREF  (denoted  by  an
        asterisk prompt §lbrack[]*§rbrack[]).


   Related Commands

        LOAD-class commands     for producing .CRF files


   Examples

        1.  Give the CREF command to obtain a listing of your .CRF file.

            @§uline[CREF]
            CREF:   TESTF1

        2.  Compile two FORTRAN  programs,  using  the  /CREF  switch  to
            produce  .CRF  files.   Then  give the CREF command to obtain
            listings of these, and use the /P switch to preserve the .CRF
            files.

        3.  Determine what .CRF files you have, then mount a tape.   Give
            the  CREF command, and once within the CREF program, have the
            cross-reference listing produced  from  one  of  these  files
            copied   onto  tape.   (The  .CRF  files  are  not  processed
            automatically when you give the  CREF  command  because  they
            were produced during a previous terminal session.)

   Caution

        Inefficiency of CSAVE Compared to SAVE

             The CSAVE  command  saves  in  a  compressed-formatted  file
             whatever  program the system finds in memory.  When the file
             is returned to memory, this format prevents other users from
             sharing  the  in-memory  copy  of  the  file.  Therefore you
             should ordinarily use the SAVE command instead  for  storing
             programs in executable format.


   Related Commands

                                      run, or merged


   Characteristics

        If a Debugging Program is Already Loaded

             If you have already loaded a debugging program  into  memory
             along   with  your  program,  the  DDT  command  starts  the
             debugging program.

        If Your Program, But Not a Debugging Program, is Already Loaded

             If a program containing  symbols  is  in  memory  without  a
             debugging  program, the DDT command merges SYS:XDDT.EXE into
             memory, then starts this  debugging  program.   However,  if
             some  of  XDDT's pages include some of the same pages as the
             existing program in memory, then  the  DDT  program  is  not
             placed  into  memory,  and  you  receive  the error message,
             "?Illegal to overlay existing pages." To force the pages  to
             be  overlaid,  reissue  the  DDT  command using the /OVERLAY
             switch.

        If There is No Current Program

             If you do not have a program in memory, or if no program  in
             memory  is  in the current fork, or if your program does not
             contain symbols, the  DDT  command  puts  SYS:XDDT.EXE  into
             memory and starts it.

        Compatibility with Previous DDT Versions

             The UDDT program run by the DDT command has been replaced by
             the  XDDT  program.   For  compatibility  with programs that
             reference UDDT, a stub program  named  UDDT  references  the
             XDDT program.


   Hints

        Using DDT to Create a Program

             You can use DDT to begin typing instructions  directly  into
             memory,  without  first putting the instructions into a file
             for later compilation and loading.  Give a RESET .  (period)
             command  to  clear  the  current fork, then the DDT command.
             This will load the SYS:XDDT.EXE program.  Then you can  give
             commands within XDDT to create your own program.  When using
             the XDDT program, you can use all the symbols in the  system
             parameter file MONSYM.MAC.

             See the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[Monitor]  §uline[Calls]  §uline[Reference]  §uline[Manual]  for  more
             information  about  MONSYM.MAC.   This  method  of writing a
             program is most useful for testing  special  cases,  or  for
             learning to use TOPS-20 monitor calls.


   Special Cases

        Using COBDDT

             If you put COBDDT into memory along with  a  COBOL  program,
             the  DDT  command  starts the UDDT program, not COBDDT.  Use
             the REENTER command to start COBDDT in this case.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The DDT command merges the SYS:UDDT.EXE program into the  current
        fork  and  starts  it,  or loads and starts SYS:XDDT.EXE.  If you
        have already loaded a debugging program, the DDT  command  starts
        this program.

   §textbf[2.22]  §textbf[DEASSIGN]

   Releases a device from your job and places the device back in the pool
   of available devices.


   Format

        @§textbf[DEASSIGN] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]

        where:

        dev:      is the name of the device  you  want  to  deassign;  an
                  asterisk  (*) deassigns all devices (except your log-in
                  terminal) assigned to your job.  The  colon  after  the
                  device name is optional.


   Restrictions

        Open Files

             The DEASSIGN command will not  deassign  a  device  that  is
             accessing  an  open  file.   An  error is generated, and the
             device is not deassigned until that file is closed or  until
             you log out.  When you log out, all devices are deassigned.

        /CROSS-REFERENCE
                         creates  a   file   containing   cross-reference
                         information  for each compilation.  The filename
                         is that of the object file;  the  file  type  is
                         .CRF.   Use the CREF command to obtain a listing
                         of the file.   (For  COBOL  files,  this  switch
                         automatically    produces    a   cross-reference

                         during compilation.  (For FORTRAN programs only,

                         in double quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIBRARY         same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST            prints a line printer listing of the program  in
                         ASCII  format;  the  name of this listing is the
                         filename of the object file.  The  /CREF  switch
                         overrides /LIST when they both apply to the same
                         file.

        /MAC             same as /MACRO.

        /MACHINE-CODE    produces a file containing the generated machine
                         code.   The filename is that of the object file;
                         the  file  type  is  .LST.    For   high   level
                         languages.

                              §textbf[Default] for files of type .MAC

        /MAP             produces a loader map and stores it in the  file
                         object.MAP,  where  object  is  the  name of the

                         start address) nnnLNK.MAP, where nnn is your job
                         number.

        /NOBINARY        prevents generation of an object (binary)  file.
                         Use  this  switch  along  with /LIST or /CREF to
                         allow these  switches  to  take  effect  without
                         producing a new object file.

        /NOCOMPILE       prevents compilation if  the  associated  object
                         file    is    current;   otherwise   it   forces
                         compilation.    Cancels    the    /COMPILE    or

                         system continues executing  the  DEBUG  command.
                         You immediately receive the TOPS-20 prompt (@ or
                         $) and can then  issue  any  user  command.   Be
                         careful  not  to send incorrect data to programs

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before debugging programs, the  system  ordinarily  compiles
             any source (and only those sources) whose write date is more
             recent than that of the object file of the same  name.   You


                                   2-107

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(DEBUG)]


             can  override  this action with the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE
             switch.  Note that the DDT debugging program  is  used  when
             /RELOCATABLE prevents a new compilation.

        Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler

             Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
             to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
             the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
             the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.

        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL, or.  ALG) in a DEBUG command, the system automatically
             calls  the  appropriate   compiler   when   compilation   is
             necessary.   If  you  specify source files by filename only,
             the system searches your connected directory  in  the  above
             order for a file of this name and a standard type.  To debug
             programs from sources that have nonstandard file types, give
             a  switch to indicate the proper compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO,
             /COBOL, or /ALGOL).  A switch will take  precedence  over  a
             standard file type if they indicate different languages.  If
             no compiler is indicated with either a switch or a  standard
             file type, the FORTRAN compiler is used.

        Name of Debugging Program Loaded by DEBUG

             Ordinarily  the  DEBUG  command   causes   the   appropriate
             debugging  program  to  be  loaded  along  with your program
             (FORDDT with FORTRAN programs.  COBDDT with COBOL  programs,
             DDT  with MACRO and ALGOL programs).  Use the /DDT switch to
             specify that DDT be used.


   Hints

        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs  separated  by  commas  as
             arguments  to  DEBUG, the loaded programs exist in memory at
             the same time and will act as a single program.  You can use
             this  feature  to  substitute  one  module for another under
             varying conditions or for different applications.

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+) as arguments to DEBUG, they are treated as a single file
             by compilers.  Their  object  module  is  stored  under  any
             filename  given  as the "object" argument of the command, or


                                   2-108

             (if none) under the last filename in the group and file type
             .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  a  DEBUG  command  in  an  indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as  a
             DEBUG command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to  the  DEBUG command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.

        Including all FORTRAN Debugging Information

             If you are debugging a  FORTRAN  program  and  you  wish  to
             examine  line  numbers or DO loops, or use statement tracing
             or array dimension checking, give the  /DEBUG  and  /COMPILE
             switches  with  the  DEBUG  command to include the necessary
             information.

        Running LINK Directly

             The DEBUG command  automatically  runs  LINK,  the  system's
             loader  program,  but  if you require control of the loading
             process you can run LINK directly.   See  the  §uline[TOPS-20]  §uline[LINK]
             §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].

        Wildcards Illegal with DEBUG

             The DEBUG command does not accept wildcard characters (* and
             %) in a file specification.


   Effect on Memory

        The DEBUG command clears any unkept forks from memory, loads  the
        appropriate  compiler if necessary, then loads your program and a
        compatible debugging program.

   Characteristics

        Colon Designates a Logical Name

             Normally, when you give a logical name to an EXEC command in
             the  place  of a file specification, structure, or directory
             name, a colon must follow the logical  name.   However,  for
             the DEFINE and INFORMATION LOGICAL-NAMES commands, where the
             argument can only be a  logical  name,  a  colon  after  the
             logical name is optional.


   Hints

        DEFINE in LOGIN.CMD File

             Your DEFINE  command  is  valid  for  the  current  terminal
             session  only.   If  there are logical names that you always
             want to use, put DEFINE commands into a LOGIN.CMD  (or,  for
             batch  jobs  started  by  SUBMIT commands within the control
             files of other batch jobs, a BATCH.CMD) file in your  log-in
             directory.

        Redefining System Logical Names

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  redefine  any  system


                                   2-112

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(DEFINE)]


             logical  name  for  your  own  job.   By  repeating a system
             logical  name  in  its  own  search  list  you  expand   its
             definition  to  include  the  other  items, in the order you
             specify.  Consider the system logical name  SYS:,  which  is
             searched  whenever  you  give  a  program name in place of a
             TOPS-20   command.    If   you   redefine   SYS:    to    be
             str:<directory>,    SYS:    you    can   run   programs   in
             str:<directory> by typing just their names.  This will  work
             as  long  as  the  program names are not the same as TOPS-20
             commands.

        Logical Names as Dummy File Specifications

             You can use logical names as dummies for file specifications
             or devices when writing programs.  Then, just before running
             such a program, use the DEFINE command to  define  these  as
             real  file  specifications  or devices, without changing the
             program itself.

        More Information

             For more information about  using  logical  names,  see  the
             §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].


   Special Cases

        Using Recognition in the File Specifications

             Normally,  when  you  attempt  to  use  recognition   in   a
             nonexistent  filename,  the  system rings the terminal bell.
             However, for the DEFINE  command,  instead  of  ringing  the
             terminal  bell, the system may append part(s) of the default
             file  specification,  .0  or  ..0,  to  the   logical   name
             definition.   This  is because DEFINE allows you to define a
             directory or file specifications that may not yet exist.

             Note that a logical name definition that includes .0 or  ..0
             may  not  work  for  your  use  of  the  logical name; it is
             recommended that you specify the complete directory name  or
             file specifications.


   Restriction

        Adding Comments to a DEFINE Command Line

             You can add a comment to the end of any TOPS-20  command  by

        Using Short Logical Names Only

             Although logical names can be up to 39 characters  long  and
             can  include  dollar  signs ($), hyphens (-), and underlines
             (_), some commands and programs (such as programs originally
             written  for  the  TOPS-10  operating  system) accept a more
             limited set of logical names.  These can be no more  than  6
             characters  long and cannot include any special symbols.  If
             all your logical names  are  of  this  kind,  they  will  be
             acceptable to any TOPS-20 programs and commands.

   Output

        Notice of Deleted Archived Files

             Whenever an archived file is completely expunged as a result
             of  your  DELETE  command  (that  is, when you also give the
             ARCHIVE subcommand),  the  operator  sends  a  mail  message
             notifying the owner of the directory from which the file was
             taken.


   Characteristics

        Privileged Subcommands to DELETE

             The DIRECTORY and FORGET subcommands to the  DELETE  command
             are  intended  for privileged users only, and only as a last
             resort, because they withhold freed disk space  from  system
             use.   Users with enabled WHEEL or OPERATOR capabilities can
             run the CHECKD program to recover this disk space.

             DIRECTORY should not be used unless the KILL subcommand to a
             BUILD  command fails to delete the directory.  FORGET is for
             removing damaged files from directories, and should  not  be
             used  unless  DELETE without subcommands fails to delete the
             file.


   Hints

        Removing Open Files

             If DELETE with the EXPUNGE subcommand fails to erase a file,
             it  may  be  that some job in the system has opened it.  The
             INFORMATION FILE-STATUS command tells whether your  own  job


                                   2-116

                                  §textbf[(DELETE)]


             has  done  so.  If it has, give the CLOSE or (if the file is
             mapped) RESET command before repeating DELETE and EXPUNGE.

        Recovering Deleted Archived Files

             If you have  given  the  DELETE  command  with  the  ARCHIVE
             subcommand to delete an archived file, and the disk copy has
             already been expunged, you may still be able to recover  the
             tape  copy.   The  operator  will  send  a MAIL message (see
             Output, above) concerning the discarded  tape  copy  of  the
             deleted    file.    Use   this   information,   along   with
             Hints - Undoing DISCARD, in the DISCARD command description,
             to attempt recovery of the deleted file.


   Special Cases

        Files With the "Permanent" Attribute

             The system erases only the contents of any files  that  have
             the  Permanent  attribute  (for  example,  MAIL.TXT  in your
             log-in directory) when you include them in a DELETE command.
             Their  file  specifications remain among your deleted files,
             and cannot be removed by TOPS-20 commands.


   Restrictions

        Using Logical Names When Specifying Files for Deletion

             If you include a logical name when specifying arguments to a
             DELETE  command,  the  system  will search for the specified
             file in only the  first  directory  of  the  logical  name's
             definition.    This   restriction  prevents  the  accidental
             deletion of another file if the file you intended to  delete
             has already been deleted.

        Using the LARGER/SMALLER and BEFORE/SINCE Subcommands Together

             You  can  use  size-related  and  time-related   subcommands
             together.   However, error messages are displayed if you use
             the LARGER/SMALLER pairing and the SMALLER number  of  pages
             exceeds  the  LARGER  number,  or  you  use the BEFORE/SINCE
             pairing and the SINCE date is later than the BEFORE date.

             deleted files, unless you included the EXPUNGE subcommand to
             DELETE  or  gave  a subsequent EXPUNGE command.  However, if
             any user or a batch job logs out  while  connected  to  your
             directory,  all deleted files are permanently erased.  Also,
             if available disk space is low on the system,  the  operator
             or  the  system  itself may expunge all deleted files from a
             structure even though you have not logged  out.   A  warning
             message is usually sent before this happens.

   Output

        Status of Pages

             When you complete a DEPOSIT command, the system gives you  a
             message  indicating the status of the page you are trying to
             change:    "§lbrack[]New§rbrack[]"   for   previously   nonexistent   pages,
             "§lbrack[]Shared§rbrack[]" for those having Copy-on-Write status, or "?Can't
             write that page" for other pages.  (See also Hints - Setting
             the  Page-access  of  Memory  Pages,  below.)   However,  no
             message is printed for deposits made to private pages.


   Hints

        Using Symbols

             For symbols that  are  defined  in  multiple  modules  of  a
             program,  you  can  be  specific  by  giving the module name
             followed by an ampersand (&) and the symbol name.

        Using DDT Instead

             Usually the DEPOSIT  command  is  unnecessary,  as  the  DDT
             program  provides  more  powerful  methods for modifying the
             contents of memory.

        Abbreviating DEPOSIT Arguments

             The contents of each memory location are represented as  two
             6-digit  octal  numbers.   By  inserting  a  pair  of commas
             between these two numbers, you  can  abbreviate  them.   For
             example,   to  deposit  000004000050  into  memory  location
             151003, use the command



                                   2-120

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                 §textbf[(DEPOSIT)]


                  @DEPOSIT 151003 4,,50

             This is the same as

                  @DEPOSIT 151003 4000050

             Note that you can also insert  commas  between  expressions.
             For example, the command

                  @DEPOSIT 1 1+3,, 5+7

             deposits 000004000014 into memory location 1.   (Expressions
             are  considered to be octal unless they contain an 8 or a 9,
             in which case they are considered  to  be  decimal  and  are
             translated to octal.)

             The DEPOSIT command itself can be abbreviated by the  single
             letter D.

        Deposit Address Defaults to the One Examined, and Vice Versa

             The first argument of a  DEPOSIT  command  defaults  to  the
             address  examined by your most recent EXAMINE command.  (You
             must press the  ESCAPE  key  to  take  this  default.)   The
             argument of an EXAMINE command defaults to the address whose
             contents were modified by your most recent DEPOSIT  command.
             Therefore  you  can examine a memory location, deposit a new
             value in it, and verify your action,  while  specifying  the
             location  only  once.   If you give DEPOSIT commands without
             intervening EXAMINE commands (or vice  versa),  the  default
             address increases by 1 for each subsequent command.

        Setting the Page-access of Memory Pages

             If the system responds to a DEPOSIT command  with  an  error
             message  of the form, "?Can't write that page", give the SET
             PAGE-ACCESS COPY-ON-WRITE command for the page.   Then  give
             DEPOSIT  again.   If the system allows it, you will be given
             your own copy of the page to modify.

        Using DEPOSIT With Inferior Processes

             To  modify  memory  for  a  process  inferior  to  the   one
             immediately  below  the  TOPS-20 command processor, you must
             give the FORK command to specify this process  before  using
             DEPOSIT.   Remember that for an inferior process to run, all
             superior  processes  must  be  running   too.    INFORMATION
             PROGRAM-STATUS tells you which processes these are.

   §textbf[2.27]  §textbf[DETACH]

   Disconnects your job from your terminal.


   Format

        @§textbf[DETACH] (AND) §textbf[argument]

        where:

        argument       can be one of these:

                       CONTINUE - directs the current program to proceed,
                                  just  as  if you had typed the CONTINUE
                                  command.

                       REENTER -  reenters the current program,  just  as
                                  if you had typed the REENTER command.

                       START -    starts the current program, just as  if
                                  you had typed the START command.

                            §textbf[Default] - the program is left in its  present
                            state


   Characteristics

        Effects of Detached Jobs

             Detached jobs use scarce system resources (such as  swapping
             space,  process  slots, job slots) and can prevent new users
             from logging in.


   Warning

        Programs Writing to the Controlling Terminal (Device TTY:)

             If a program running in a detached job attempts to write  to
             device TTY:, the job will wait until it is again attached to
             a terminal.


   Effect on Terminal

        The DETACH command leaves your terminal detached from the  system
        in the state before log-in.

|       If the system manager enables the hangup-on-DETACH feature,  then

                                  §textbf[(DETACH)]


|       if  a  user DETACHes from a DECSYSTEM-20, the system hangs up the
|       terminal line that user was connected to.  The job still  remains
|       detached, but the user no longer retains a terminal line.

        SUBMIT       for running independent jobs

        UNATTACH     for disengaging another job from its terminal


   Examples

        1.  Detach your job.

            @§uline[DETACH]
            Detaching job # 16

        2.  Detach your job while starting the program  in  memory,  then
            log in again.

            @§uline[DETACH] §uline[START]
             Detaching job # 45

            @§uline[LOGIN] §uline[LATTA] §uline[341]

        3.  Log in and put a program in  memory;  detach  the  job  while
            starting  this program, and repeat the entire procedure.  Log
            in a third time and  begin  execution  of  a  third  program.
            Interrupt  this execution with CTRL/C, then detach this third
            job while continuing its program.  Now you  have  three  jobs
            running  at  once.   Instead  of logging in again, attach the
            first job (specifying the job number) and verify the system's
            action.

   Hints

        Listing Unneeded Files

             In preparation for deleting files  so  that  your  directory
             will  fall  within  disk  quotas, you can get a list of your
             largest files by using the LARGER and/or  SIZE  subcommands,
             and  of  your  oldest or least-used files with DATES, TIMES,
             and BEFORE.  With FIND you can discover extra generations of
             files.

        Finding Files of a Particular Age or Size

             To examine only files of a certain age  or  size,  give  the
             pair of subcommands BEFORE and SINCE, or LARGER and SMALLER,
             with appropriate arguments.

        Comparing Checksums of Files

             You can use the numbers reported by the CHECKSUM  subcommand
             to  compare two files:  if they have differing contents they
             will almost certainly yield different values; and  identical
             files will have the same checksums.  The CHECKSUM subcommand
             causes a checksum of checksums as well.

        Asterisks Appearing Before Filespecs

             An asterisk (*) appearing before a filename in the  response
             to a DIRECTORY command indicates a possible hardware-related
             error, one caused  by  a  read  operation  at  a  marginally
             functional  area of disk.  To test whether there actually is
             an error in the file, use the COPY command to copy the  file
             to a new specification.  If the COPY command succeeds, there
             is no error in the file, and no asterisk  will  precede  the
             new  file  specification.   If  the  COPY command fails, you
             should move  the  disk  to  another  drive  and  repeat  the
             command.   If it still fails, you may have to write your own
             program to recover everything but the missing  part  of  the
             file (usually, just one page).

        DIRECTORY-class Commands for Labeled Magnetic Tapes

             The FDIRECTORY,  TDIRECTORY,  and  VDIRECTORY  commands  for
             labeled  magnetic  tapes  are  equivalent  to  the DIRECTORY
             command for labeled  magnetic  tapes.   All  these  commands
             rewind  the  tape  set to the beginning of the first volume,
             print a directory of files, then rewind the set again.   You
             can  give  only these subcommands when using DIRECTORY-class
             commands  with  labeled  magnetic  tapes:    ALPHABETICALLY,
             DOUBLESPACE,   HEADING,   LPT,   NO,  OUTPUT,  REVERSE,  and
             SEPARATE.

                                 §textbf[(DISABLE)]


   §textbf[2.29]  §textbf[DISABLE]

   Disables any special capabilities, such as those of WHEEL or OPERATOR,
   that you have enabled.


   Format

        $§textbf[DISABLE] (CAPABILITIES)
        @


   Characteristics

        Resumption of Standard Prompt

             The DISABLE command causes the system to resume the standard
             at  sign  prompt (@) in place of the dollar sign prompt ($),
             which indicated enabled capabilities.


   Warning

        Disabling Promptly

             Be sure to disable your capabilities as  soon  as  you  have
             finished using them, so that you or a program you run cannot
             accidentally damage the system.


   Related Commands

   §textbf[2.30]  §textbf[DISCARD]

   Gives up the tape copy of specified on-line files.


   Format

        @§textbf[DISCARD] (TAPE INFORMATION FOR FILES) §textbf[filespec,...]

        where:

        filespec            is the specification of  a  file  whose  tape
                            copy you want to discard.


   Characteristics

        Action of DISCARD

             The DISCARD command causes the tape pointer in the FDB (File
             Descriptor  Block)  of the specified file to be deleted.  It
             does not actually destroy the tape copy of  the  file.   The
             tape  copy  is  destroyed  when  the tape is recycled by the
             operator.  (See also Hints - Undoing DISCARD, below.)

        Withdrawing Archive Status of Files

             When you give the DISCARD command for  an  on-line  archived
             file,  you withdraw archive status from the disk copy of the
             file.  That is, the file  becomes  an  ordinary  disk  file,
             which you can edit or delete if you wish.

        DISCARD for Non-archived Files

             You can also use the DISCARD command to  give  up  the  tape
             copy   of   files   that   have   been   migrated   to  tape
             (automatically, by the system) and then retrieved using  the
             RETRIEVE command.


   Hints

        Undoing DISCARD

             You receive a mail message from the operator for every  file
             whose  tape  copy  you  discard.  The message gives the tape
             number, saveset number, and file number within  the  saveset
             of  each  tape  copy.  If you have given the DISCARD command
             for a file and later wish to use the tape copy, you  may  be
             able  to  recover  it using this information, as long as the
             tapes have not yet been recycled.

                                 See   Hints - Using   the  /STRUCTURE-ID
                                 Switch, below.


   Characteristics

        Action of DISMOUNT STRUCTURE Command

             Ordinary DISMOUNT STRUCTURE

                  The DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command reduces by 1  the  mount
                  count  of  the specified structure (the number of users
                  who have given a MOUNT but not a DISMOUNT  command  for
                  the  structure)  if  you  had  given  a  previous MOUNT
                  command for it.  An ordinary DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command
                  does not withdraw the structure from system use.

             Including /REMOVE Switch

                  If you include  the  /REMOVE  switch  when  giving  the
                  DISMOUNT  STRUCTURE command, the specified structure is
                  made  unavailable  for  further  mount  requests.   The
                  operator  is informed of your dismount request, and any
                  further action depends  on  him.   If  he  denies  your
                  request, the structure is again made available to other
                  users; if he grants your request, the structure remains
                  unavailable  for  further  mount requests, and is taken
                  off  line  and  physically  removed.    Under   extreme
                  conditions  the  operator may take a structure off line
                  and physically remove it even though  some  users  have
                  not dismounted the structure.  Before doing so, he will
                  usually send a message to such users to allow  them  to
                  close their files.

        Action of DISMOUNT TAPE Command

             The DISMOUNT TAPE  command  unloads  the  currently  mounted
             volume   of   the  specified  tape  set  (i.e.,  rewinds  it
             completely  onto  its  source  reel)  so  that  it  can   be

                                 §textbf[(DISMOUNT)]


             physically  removed  by  the  operator, and returns the tape
             drive to the pool of available resources.  (Note that if the
             /NOUNLOAD  switch  was given in your original MOUNT command,
             no volumes are unloaded by the  system  or  removed  by  the
             operator, even after your DISMOUNT command is completed.) If
             a logical name (such as the setname of the tape set) is used
             in  the DISMOUNT command to specify the tape set, the system
             also withdraws the definition  of  the  logical  name.   Use
             DISMOUNT  TAPE  only  for tape drives having device names of
             the form MTn:; drives obtained using the MOUNT command.  Use
             UNLOAD  to  unload  tapes from drives having device names of
             the form MTAn:.


   Hints

        Omitting "medium" Argument

             If the dev:  argument  of  your  DISMOUNT  command  will  be
             unambiguous  (for  example, you do not have both a structure
             and a tape set mounted using the same device name), you need
             not  specify  the  medium.   The shortened command, DISMOUNT
             dev:/switch(es), is sufficient.

        Using the /STRUCTURE-ID Switch

             The /STRUCTURE-ID switch gives the name of the structure  as
             recorded in the disk(s) of the pack itself, where it is used
             by the system for identification.  You may use  this  switch
             to dismount a structure that had been mounted using an alias
             different from its structure identification.  (See  Hints  -
             Using   the  /STRUCTURE-ID  Switch,  in  the  MOUNT  command
             description.)

        Using INFORMATION VOLUMES before DISMOUNT TAPE

             If  you  give  the  INFORMATION   VOLUMES   command   before
             dismounting  a tape set, the system will respond with a list
             of the volids for mounted volumes, including volids for  any
             volumes  newly  added  to  the  set.   You  should  keep  an
             up-to-date record  of  these  for  use  with  further  MOUNT
             commands.


   Effect on Terminal

        The  DISMOUNT  command  with  the  /NOWAIT  switch,  leaves  your
        terminal  at  TOPS-20  command  level.  If you have not given the
        /NOWAIT  switch,  your  terminal  waits  until  the  system   has
        processed  your  request, or until you give a CTRL/C to return to
        TOPS-20 command level.  This CTRL/C does not cancel your request.

                           every n EDIT program commands that modify  the

                           sign) are not ordinary textual characters  but

   Characteristics

        Edit Mode or Input Mode

             The EDIT command runs the EDIT system program in Edit  mode,
             which  uses  an  asterisk  prompt  (*).   (However, see also
             Special Cases - Using an Editor Other than EDIT, below.)  In
             Edit  mode  you  can use any EDIT program commands to modify
             the specified file.  If the EDIT program starts by  printing
             the  word Input instead of Edit, the specified file does not
             yet exist.  You are then in Input mode, just as if  you  had
             used  the  CREATE  command  instead of EDIT.  See the CREATE
             command description for details.

        Saving Backup Files Periodically

             Whenever you use EDIT, be sure to keep an extra copy of  the
             file  you  are  modifying,  in case of a system failure.  By
             default the system renames the unedited copy of your file to
             name.Qyp  at  the  end  of an editing session.  By using the
             /SAVE:n  switch  you  can  have  this  backup  file  updated
             periodically  during  the  editing  session  to reflect your
             edits.

        SWITCH.INI File

             If there is a group of EDIT command switches that you always
             or  often  use with EDIT or CREATE commands, put them into a
             file named SWITCH.INI in your log-in directory, in a line of
             that file beginning with "EDIT:abc", where abc is any set of
             characters you choose to identify the  line.   Then  if  you
             include  the single switch /OPTION:abc when you give an EDIT

             or CREATE command, all these switches will be in effect.


   Hints

        Debugging Your Programs and Editing the Sources

             You can use EDIT to modify files containing source  programs
             written  in  a  programming  language.   The  DDT  and DEBUG
             commands run system programs that offer more  efficient  and
             powerful  techniques  for  testing  temporary corrections to
             your programs, but you should use the EDIT command  to  make
             final changes to the source files.

        Further Information

             For more information about the EDIT program, see the §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[EDIT] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].


   Special Cases

        Using an Editor Other than EDIT

             The CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE command  descriptions  in  this
             manual  assume  that these commands call on the EDIT program
             for their action.  If your job uses another editing program,
             for  example  EDT, the switches and examples shown here will
             not be applicable.

             The editor used by CREATE, EDIT, and PERUSE is specified  by
             logical  name  EDITOR:, so you can find out the name of this
             program by giving  the  command,  INFORMATION  LOGICAL-NAMES
             EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition  (if any) will be given
             first, followed by the system-wide definition; the  job-wide
             definition  prevails  if  both  exist.  If the definition of
             EDITOR:  is SYS:EDIT.EXE, the CREATE and EDIT commands  will
             function  as  described in this manual.  Otherwise, you must
             consult the appropriate  manual  (for  example,  the  §uline[EDT-20]
             §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual]) for information.

             You can use  the  DEFINE  command  to  define  logical  name
             EDITOR:   to  be  any  editing  program  available  at  your
             installation.  Then this program will be in effect when  you
             give the CREATE or EDIT command.

        Attempting to Edit Archived Files

             If you attempt to edit an on-line archived file, the  system
             will let you produce an edited version of the archived file,
             but will retain the original (archived) file unchanged under


                                   2-152

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                   §textbf[(EDIT)]


             the  specification name.Qyp (or name.Zyp if you included the
             /OLD switch in the EDIT  command),  where  name.typ  is  the
             file's  original  specification.   See  also Hints - Editing
             Files of Type .Qyp, below.

        Editing Files of Type .Qyp

             If you edit a file of type .Qyp (any file whose type  begins
             with  the  letter  Q),  the  EDIT  program does not save the
             unedited copy as a backup file.  In  such  cases,  give  the
             /OLD  switch  to  retain  the  unedited copy under file type
             .Zyp.  If the file of type .Qyp is  an  archived  file,  you
             will  not be allowed to produce an altered version using the
             EDIT command unless you include the /OLD switch.


   Effect on Memory

        The EDIT command clears any unkept forks from memory, then  loads
        the editor program defined by the logical name EDITOR:.

   §textbf[2.33]  §textbf[ENABLE]

   Enables any special capabilities you may have.


   Format

        @§textbf[ENABLE] (CAPABILITIES)
        $


   Characteristics

        Dollar Sign Prompt

             The ENABLE command causes the system to print a dollar  sign
             prompt ($), indicating enabled capabilities, in place of the
             standard at sign prompt (@).   The  dollar  sign  prompt  is
             printed  after  ENABLE even if you have not been granted any
             capabilities.

        Capabilities of Log-In Directory Only

             The ENABLE command activates only  those  capabilities  that
             have  been  granted  to  the owner of your log-in directory.
             You do not receive any capabilities as a result  of  CONNECT
             or ACCESS commands or group memberships.


   Hints

        Displaying Capabilities

             Capabilities are defined by your login directory but  are  a
             characteristic  of  your  job  and  can  be  enabled  in any
             directory to which you connect.  To list your  capabilities,
             give  the  INFORMATION  DIRECTORY  command  for  your  login
             directory.

        More Information

             Capabilities are assigned with the BUILD command.   See  the
             BUILD   command   subcommands   in  this  manual  for  brief
             descriptions of special capabilities.


   Special Cases

        Dollar Sign Prompt in Batch Jobs

             Because a dollar sign placed in the location  of  a  TOPS-20

                                  §textbf[(ENABLE)]


             prompt  could  be  confused with a batch command, the system
             precedes the enabled prompt with a space for batch jobs.

        Capabilities Changed While Logged In

             Capabilities are given to your job when you log in.  If your
             capabilities  are  changed while you are logged-in, you must
             log out and log in again for the change to take effect.


   Warning

        Disabling Capabilities Promptly

             Because your commands are much more  powerful  if  you  have
             capabilities enabled, you should disable them as soon as you
             have finished using them.  Otherwise you or a  program  that
             you run could accidentally damage the system.

        where:

        dev:<directory>     is the directory to which  you  want  to  end
                            access.

                                                       structure) of  the

                                                       directory


   Hints

        Implicit END-ACCESS

             You can access only one directory at a time on each  mounted
             structure.   Each ACCESS command ends access obtained by any
             previous ACCESS command for a  directory  on  the  specified
             structure.  Therefore you do not need to give the END-ACCESS
             command if you access another directory on the structure, or
             if the structure is dismounted.

        Restoring Previous Rights

             END-ACCESS does not restore owner and group rights  obtained
             by  a  previous  ACCESS command for the specified structure.
             Give another ACCESS command to regain these.  (Note that you
             must  access  your  log-in  directory to regain group rights
             obtained by the LOGIN command,  lost  by  accessing  another
             directory on the public structure.

   §textbf[2.35]  §textbf[EOF]

   Writes an end-of-file mark on the specified magnetic tape.   Use  this
   command for unlabeled tapes only.


   Format

        @§textbf[EOF] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]

        where:

        dev:      is the name of the magnetic tape  drive  on  which  you
                  want to write an end-of-file mark.  The colon after the
                  device name is optional.

   Hints

        EOF Seldom Needed

             Because tape-writing  programs  and  commands  automatically
             write  end-of-file  marks  in the appropriate places, you do
             not ordinarily need the EOF command.  But it can  be  useful
             if  such  a  program  is interrupted (by your CTRL/C or by a
             system failure and restart) and you  want  to  preserve  the
             information already written.  Also, you can shorten files on
             an existing tape by giving an EOF  command  at  the  desired
             point.


   Restrictions

        EOF With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape  drive  and  you then give the EOF
             command for that tape drive, the system will first allow you
             to  close  the  associated file.  You must do so for the EOF
             command to succeed, but  you  will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the program from that point, because the file will
             now be closed.

   §textbf[2.36]  §textbf[ERUN]

   Runs a system program without disturbing the program already in memory
   by placing the program in an ephemeral fork.


   Format

        @§textbf[ERUN] (PROGRAM) §textbf[filespec]

        where:

        filespec       is the file specification of a system program.

                            §textbf[Default] .typ - .EXE


   Characteristics

        Characteristics of an Ephemeral Fork

             The ERUN command runs a program in  an  ephemeral  fork.   A
             program  that  runs  in  an ephemeral fork acts like an EXEC
             command (excluding those EXEC commands that run programs  or
             otherwise affect memory).  Ephemeral forks and EXEC commands
             share these characteristics:

              o  They do not affect programs in memory.  For example,  if
                 you  exit a program and issue a SYSTAT command, or run a
                 program in an ephemeral fork, neither  the  command  nor
                 the ephemeral fork will disturb the program in memory.

                 A program that runs ephemerally is always  placed  in  a
                 new fork.

              o  They  disappear  when  interrupted  or  when  processing
                 completes.   For  example,  if  you  stop execution of a
                 SYSTAT command or an ephemeral fork with CTRL/C, neither
                 the command nor the ephemeral fork can be continued.

                 Whenever you stop or exit an ephemeral fork, the fork is
                 automatically reset (cleared from memory).

             Good candidates for ephemeral forks are  programs  that  may
             have short execution times and simply display information in
             a manner similar to the INFORMATION and SYSTAT commands.

   Displays the contents of a memory location.


   Format

        @§textbf[EXAMINE] (MEMORY LOCATION) §textbf[octal] §textbf[or] §textbf[symbolic] §textbf[address]


   Output

        Contents of Memory Location or Message

             When you complete an EXAMINE command, the system prints  the
             memory  address  examined,  followed  by a slash (/) and its
             contents.  If you  previously  used  the  SET  TYPEOUT  MODE
             SYMBOLIC  command, this information is both in symbolic and,
             in  parentheses,  numeric  (octal)  format.   (The   numeric
             information  will  always  appear  for  this  setting of the
             command; symbolic information  will  appear  if  the  system
             finds that it is different from the numeric.)

             Generally the numeric format shows two 6-digit octal numbers
             separated  by a pair of commas (,,).  If you do not see this
             pair of commas, only the right half of the  memory  location
             is  being displayed; as the left half is 0.  However, if you
             are not permitted  to  examine  this  location,  the  system
             prints only a message telling you of the restriction.


   Hints

        Using Symbols

             For symbols that  are  defined  in  multiple  modules  of  a
             program,  you  can  be  specific  by  giving the module name
             followed by an ampersand (&) and the symbol name.

        Abbreviating EXAMINE

             The EXAMINE command can be abbreviated by the single  letter
             E.

        Default Argument for EXAMINE

             The argument of your current EXAMINE command defaults  to  a
             value  greater by 1 than the last address examined, allowing
             you to inspect a section of memory with only  a  minimum  of
             typing.   But if you gave a more recent DEPOSIT command, the
             argument of your current EXAMINE command  defaults  to  that
             address, allowing you to verify the deposit.

        Using EXAMINE With Noncurrent and Inferior Forks

             The EXAMINE command displays memory locations of the current
             fork.   To  examine  the  memory  of  noncurrent or inferior
             forks, make the fork the current fork  by  giving  the  FORK
             command with the fork name or number as an argument.

             To run an inferior fork after examining it, you must  ensure
             that  all superior forks are running too.  Give the CONTINUE
             command with the superior fork name or number as an argument
             to let the superior fork continue its inferiors.

        Descriptions of these switches are  given  below.   Although  the
        system  will  not  reject  switches  described  under  any of the
        LOAD-class commands, only those switches commonly associated with
        EXECUTE are described here.

        /74-COBOL         compiles the file using the COBOL-74 compiler.
                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .C74 or .74C

        /ABORT            stops a compile if a fatal  error  is  detected
                          and  returns  your  terminal to TOPS-20 command
                          level.

        /ALGOL            compiles the file using the ALGOL compiler.
                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .ALG

        /BINARY           allows generation of an  object  (binary)  file
                          for each source file given.
                               §textbf[Default]

        /COBOL            compiles the file  using  the  COBOL  compiler,
                          either   COBOL-68   or   COBOL-74,   that  your
                          installation   has   stored   in    the    file

                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .CBL

        /COMPILE          forces compilation of the source file even if a
                          current  object  file already exists.  Use this
                          switch along with a /LIST or  /CREF  switch  to
                          obtain  listings  when  you have current object
                          files.

        /CREF             same as /CROSS-REFERENCE.

        /CROSS-REFERENCE
                          creates  a  file   containing   cross-reference
                          information  for  each  compilation.   The file
                          name is that of the object file; the file  type
                          is  .CRF.   Use  the  CREF  command to obtain a
                          listing of the file.   (For  COBOL  files  this
                          switch automatically produces a cross-reference
                          listing.)
                               §textbf[Default]

        /DDT              loads the DDT debugging program along with your
                          object file.

        /DEBUG            produces an object  file  containing  debugging
                          information  beyond  what  is  usually inserted
                          during  compilation.   (For  FORTRAN   programs
                          only,  and  only  if  you  have  not  given the
                          /OPTIMIZE switch).

        /FAIL             compiles the file using the FAIL compiler.

                               §textbf[Default]  for files of type .FOR

        /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES:"/switch(es)"
                          passes the specified switches to  the  compiler
                          that  will  process  the  file(s) to which this
                          switch applies.  You must include the  switches
                          in double quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIBRARY          same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST             prints a line printer listing of the program in
                          ASCII  format;  the name of this listing is the
                          filename of the object file.  The /CREF  switch
                          overrides  /LIST  when  they  both apply to the
                          same file.

        /MAC              same as /MACRO.


        /MACHINE-CODE     produces  a  file  containing   the   generated
                          machine  code.   The  filename  is  that of the
                          object  file;  the  file  type  is  .LST.   For
                          high-level languages.

        /MACRO            assembles the file using the MACRO assembler.
                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .MAC

        /MAP              produces a loader map and stores it in the file
                          object.MAP,  where  object  is  the name of the
                          module containing the start address; or (if  no
                          start  address)  nnnLNK.MAP,  where nnn is your
                          job number.

        /NOBINARY         prevents generation of an object (binary) file.
                          Use  this  switch  along with /LIST or /CREF to
                          allow these switches  to  take  effect  without
                          producing a new object file.

        /NOCOMPILE        prevents compilation  if  the  object  file  is
                          current;   otherwise   it  forces  compilation.
                          Cancels the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE switch.

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before executing programs, the  system  ordinarily  compiles
             any source (and only those sources) whose write date is more
             recent that that of the object file of the same  name.   You
             can  override  this action with the /COMPILE or /RELOCATABLE
             switch.

        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             .CBL,   or   .ALG)   in  an  EXECUTE  command,   the  system
             automatically   calls   the   appropriate   compiler    when
             compilation  is  necessary.   If you specify source files by
             filename only,  the system searches your connected directory
             in  the  above  order for a file of this name and a standard
             type.   To  execute  programs   from   sources   that   have
             nonstandard file types, give a switch to indicate the proper
             compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or  /ALGOL).   A  switch
             will  take  precedence  over  a  standard  file type if they
             indicate different languages.  If no compiler  is  indicated
             with  either  a  switch or a standard file type, the FORTRAN
             compiler is used.

        Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler

             Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
             to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
             the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
             the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.


   Hints

        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs  separated  by  commas  as
             arguments to EXECUTE, the loaded programs exist in memory at
             the same time and will act as a single program.  You can use
             this  feature  to  substitute  one  module for another under
             varying conditions or for different applications.

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs separated  by  plus  signs
             (+)  as  arguments  to EXECUTE, they are treated as a single
             file by compilers.  Their object module is stored under  any
             filename  given  as the "object" argument of the command, or
             (if none) under the last filename in the group and file type

             .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You can store the arguments (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches)  of  an  EXECUTE  command in an indirect file, and
             specify them by typing an at sign (@) and its filespec as an
             EXECUTE command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set  up  default  global  arguments  to the EXECUTE command.
             Insert this SET command in your COMAND.CMD  file  to  change
             your own defaults permanently.

        Running LINK Directly

             The EXECUTE command automatically runs  LINK,  the  system's
             loader  program,  but  if you require control of the loading
             process you can run LINK directly.   See  the  §uline[TOPS-20]  §uline[LINK]
             §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].

        Wildcards Illegal with EXECUTE

             The EXECUTE command does not accept wildcard  characters  (*
             and %) in a file specification.


   Effect on Memory

        The EXECUTE command clears any unkept forks  from  memory,  loads
        the appropriate compiler if necessary, then loads and starts your
        program.

        being written in the directory during the EXPUNGE, or (especially
        if you include the REBUILD subcommand) that previous computations
        of  directory  size  had not adequately accounted for some files,
        for example, files written near the time of a  system  crash  and
        reload.


   Hints

        Using the REBUILD Subcommand

             The REBUILD subcommand is not needed under usual conditions,
             as  the  system  performs  this  action  automatically.  Use
             REBUILD if a message is printed on  your  terminal  advising
             you to rebuild the symbol table of a directory.

        Using the PURGE Subcommand

             The PURGE subcommand is  useful  chiefly  for  removing  the
             remains  of  files  that were being created at the time of a
             system crash or a structure dismount.  Do not give it  while
             anyone  might  be  using  the directory, because that user's
             program might be deprived of necessary files as a result.

|       Cannot CTRL/C

|            You cannot use <CTRL/C> to interrupt an EXPUNGE once  it  is
|            started.


   Special Cases

        Files With the "Permanent" Attribute

             The system erases only the contents of any files  that  have
             the  Permanent  attribute,  for  example your MAIL.TXT file,
             when you try to expunge them.  The  file  specifications  of
             permanent  files remain among your deleted files, and cannot
             be removed by TOPS-20 commands.

   Characteristics

        Default Fork

             If you do not specify a fork name or number  with  the  FORK
             command,  the fork with the highest fork number (usually the
             last fork created) becomes your current fork, and  the  fork
             name is printed in brackets, §lbrack[]FORK-NAME§rbrack[].

        Fork Name and Number

             Forks are named after  the  program  they  contain  and  are
             numbered   in   the   order   that  they  are  created.   In
             multiforking class commands, the fork name  and  number  are
             interchangeable.


   Hints

        More Information

             The FORK command is one of  the  TOPS-20  multiforking-class
             commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the

                                  §textbf[(FREEZE)]


   §textbf[2.42]  §textbf[FREEZE]

   Halts execution of a fork.


   Format

        @§textbf[FREEZE] (FORK) §textbf[fork]

        where:

        fork is one of the following:  Fork name
                                       Fork number
                                            §textbf[Default] - the current fork


   Characteristics

        Same Function as CTRL/C

             The FREEZE command stops running background forks while  you
             are at EXEC command level.  The effect is the same as if you
             typed two CTRL/Cs while at the fork's program level.


   Hints

        More Information

             The FREEZE command is one of the TOPS-20  multiforking-class
             commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
             section named, Running Multiple  Programs,  in  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].

   Examples

        1.  Give  the  FREEZE  command  to  stop  the   current   running
            background  fork.   Then, display the fork status.  The arrow
            points to the current fork.

        2.  Display the fork status and give the FREEZE command to stop a
            running  background fork.  Then, redisplay the fork status to
            check the result.

                                   §textbf[(GET)]


   §textbf[2.43]  §textbf[GET]

   Places an executable program into memory.


   Format

        @§textbf[GET] (PROGRAM) §textbf[filespec] §textbf[/switch]

        where:

        filespec       is the specification of  any  file  containing  an
                       executable program.
                            §textbf[Default] file type - .EXE

        /switch        is   /USE-SECTION:n
                            specifies the memory section (from  0  to  37
                            octal)  into  which  your  program  is  to be
                            loaded.  You can use this switch only if your
                            program can be contained in one section.


   Effect on Memory

        The GET command clears  any  unkept  forks,  puts  the  specified
        program into memory.

   Examples

        1.  Ask for information about the FILCOM program.

            @§uline[HELP] §uline[FILCOM]
            FILCOM V21B(60)

            FILCOM compares two files in either ASCII mode 
            or binary depending upon switches or file name extensions.  
            All standard binary extensions are recognized as binary by 
             default.
            Switches are :-
            /A compare in ASCII mode
                    .
                    .
                    .
            /W compare the Word mode but don't expand files
            /X expand files before word mode compare

        2.  Use the DIRECTORY command to search system logical name  HLP:
            for  any  text  involving  mail.   (Note  the use of wildcard
            characters here.) Then, print a  copy  of  one  of  the  help
            files.

                               §textbf[(INFORMATION)]


             Use the FORK command to specify the fork to be described  by
             the  ADDRESS-BREAK,  FILE-STATUS,  MEMORY-USAGE  and VERSION
             arguments.  Find out  your  current  fork  with  INFORMATION

   Restrictions

        Using the INFORMATION OUTPUT-REQUESTS /DESTINATION-NODE switch

             For non-privileged users, the local node's GALAXY must  know
             if the remote node has printers.  If the user is privileged,
             then the print  request  queue  of  the  node  specified  is
             displayed,  regardless  of whether the local GALAXY knows if
             the node has printers or not.  The user specified node  must
             be a node in the cluster known to the local GALAXY.

             If the node specified by the /DESTINATION-NODE switch is the
             local  node,  then the print request queue of the local node
             is displayed.

             You cannot use an * as an argument in the  /DESTINATION-NODE
             switch.

   Examples

        1.  Use an INFORMATION command to determine your current terminal
            settings.

        2.  Mount a structure and access your directory on the structure.
            Compare  the  disk  space  available in this directory and in
            your connected directory.  (Note that  there  are  many  more
            pages  free  on  your  connected structure (MISC:) as a whole
            than on structure SNARK:; this is likely to make your use  of
            the system more efficient if you work only within MISC:.)

   Protects a fork from being cleared from memory.


   Format

        @§textbf[KEEP] (FORK) §textbf[fork]

        where:

        fork is one of the following:  Fork name
                                       Fork number
                                            §textbf[Default] - the current fork


   Characteristics

        Characteristics of Kept Forks

             The KEEP command gives a fork a "kept" status.  A kept  fork
             has these characteristics:

              o  A kept fork is not reset when another program is brought
                 into  memory.   Normally,  when  a  program  is  run, it
                 replaces the fork currently in memory.  However, if  the
                 program in memory is in a kept fork and a new program is
                 run, the new program is placed  in  a  new  fork.   This
                 allows you to have several programs in memory.

              o  A kept fork is not cleared from memory  with  the  RESET
                 command   unless   one   of  these  RESET  arguments  is
                 specified:  the fork name, a period or an asterisk.

              o  A kept fork can be restarted by  typing  the  kept  fork
                 name  as  an  EXEC  command.   The kept fork name can be
                 abbreviated to the point where it is  unique  from  EXEC
                 commands  and other kept fork names.  ESCAPE recognition
                 and question mark help  also  function  with  kept  fork
                 names.

                 The KEEP command sets the kept fork to  restart  at  its
                 starting  address  when the kept fork name is given as a
                 command.  For information on changing the fork's restart
                 address  see  Hints,  Setting  the  Kept  Fork's Restart
                 Address.

              o  A kept fork is named  after  the  program  it  contains.
                 Forks  are  numbered  in  the  order  in which they were
                 created.  In multiforking-class commands the  fork  name
                 and number are interchangecable.

                                   §textbf[(KEEP)]


        Inferior Forks

             Any inferior forks created by a kept fork are also kept.


   Hints

        Keeping Forks Automatically

             Place  SET  PROGRAM  KEEP  commands  in  your  LOGIN.CMD  or
             COMAND.CMD file for programs that you normally place in kept
             forks.   Then  when  you  load  the  program,   the   system
             automatically  keeps  the  fork  and  notifies  you with the
             message §lbrack[]Keeping FORK-NAME§rbrack[].

             The SET PROGRAM command applies only  to  the  current  EXEC
             level.   If  you  want  your  SET  PROGRAM commands to be in
             effect after a PUSH command,  put  the  commands  into  your
             COMAND.CMD   file.    The   COMAND.CMD   file   is  executed
             automatically after every PUSH command.

        Kept Forks Continued Using the Fork Name

             The KEEP command sets  the  fork  to  be  restarted  at  its
             starting  point  when  the  fork name is given as a command.
             So, if a program that was kept  with  the  KEEP  command  is
             running  in  a  background  fork, and you type the kept fork
             name, execution of the program is canceled and  the  program
             returns to its start address, which is usually the program's
             prompt.

             With the SET PROGRAM KEEP command, you to specify the  point
             at  which  the fork will restart when the fork name is given
             as a command.  The  starting  point  can  be  the  program's
             continue,  reentry,  or  start  address.   The  command  SET
             PROGRAM KEEP CONTINUE gives the fork name the same  function
             as  the  CONTINUE  /NORMALLY command.  So, if a program that
             was kept with the  SET  PROGRAM  KEEP  CONTINUE  command  is
             running  in  a  background  fork, and you type the kept fork
             name, execution of the program continues and  your  terminal
             is placed at program level.

        More Information

             The KEEP command is one of  the  TOPS-20  multiforking-class
             commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
             section named, Running Multiple  Programs,  in  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].

   Restrictions

        Limited Number of Forks

             There is a limited number of forks available  on  a  system.
             When  all  forks are in use, existing users cannot add forks
             and new users cannot log in.  Therefore, KEEP only necessary
             forks and return idle forks to the system with the UNKEEP or
             RESET commands.


   Related Commands

        /LANGUAGE-SWITCHES:"/switch(es)"
                          passes the specified switches to  the  compiler
                          that  will  process  the  file(s)  to which the
                          switch applies.  You must include the  switches
                          in double quotation marks ("  ").

        /LIBRARY          same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST             prints a line printer listing of the program in
                          ASCII  format.  The name of this listing is the
                          filename of the object file.  The /CREF  switch
                          overrides  /LIST  when  they  both apply to the
                          same file.

        /MAC              same as /MACRO.

        /MACHINE-CODE     produces  a  file  containing   the   generated
                          machine  code.   The  filename  is  that of the
                          object  file;  the  file  type  is  .LST.   For
                          high-level languages.

        /MACRO            assembles the file using the MACRO assembler.
                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .MAC

        /MAP              produces a loader map and stores it in the file
                          object.MAP,  where  object  is  the name of the
                          module containing the start address; or (if  no
                          start  address)  nnnLNK.MAP,  where nnn is your
                          job number.

        /NOBINARY         prevents generation of an object (binary) file.
                          Use  this  switch  along with /LIST or /CREF to
                          allow these switches  to  take  effect  without
                          producing a new object file.

        /NOCOMPILE        prevents compilation if the  associated  object
                          file    is   current;   otherwise   it   forces
                          compilation.    Cancels   the    /COMPILE    or
                          /RELOCATABLE switch.

        /NOCROSS-REFERENCE
                          prevents  the  creation  of  a  cross-reference
                          file.
                               §textbf[Default]

                               §textbf[Default]

        /NOOPTIMIZE       prevents the generation of a globally optimized
                          object file (for FORTRAN programs only).
                               §textbf[Default]

                          command line) to be loaded even if they are not
                          called  by  your  program.  Cancels the /SEARCH

                          default for the compiler.

        /NOSYMBOLS        prevents a symbol table from being loaded along
                          with the object file.

        /NOWARNINGS       prevents  display  of  warnings  for   nonfatal
                          errors.

        /OPTIMIZE         calls for generation of  a  globally  optimized
                          object  file, that is, one that runs as quickly
                          as possible (for  FORTRAN  programs  only,  and
                          only  if  you  do  not  also  give  the  /DEBUG

                               §textbf[Default] for files of type .SAI

        /SEARCH           requires that the object file library (the file
                          accompanied by this switch in the command line)
                          be searched for modules called by your  program
                          or by a program subroutine.  Only these modules
                          are loaded, along with modules called from  the
                          system libraries, which are always searched.

        /STAY             returns your terminal to TOPS-20 command  level
                          so  that  you  can perform other work while the
                          system continues to  load  your  program.   You
                          immediately  receive  the  TOPS-20 prompt (@ or

                          job;  and  issue  a  CONTINUE  /STAY command to
                          remain at command level during loading.

   Characteristics

        Compiling New Sources Only

             Before loading programs, the system ordinarily compiles  any
             specified  source  (and only those sources) whose write date
             is more recent than that of the  object  file  of  the  same
             name.   You  can  override  this action with the /COMPILE or
             /RELOCATABLE switch.

                                   §textbf[(LOAD)]


        Using Standard File Types

             If you specify source files with standard types (.FOR, .MAC,
             for  example)  in  a  LOAD command, the system automatically
             calls  the  appropriate   compiler   when   compilation   is
             necessary.   If  you  specify source files by filename only,
             the system searches your connected directory for a  file  of
             this  name  and  a  standard  type.   To  load programs from
             sources that have nonstandard file types, give a  switch  to
             indicate  the  proper compiler (/FORTRAN, /MACRO, /COBOL, or
             /ALGOL).  A switch will take precedence over a standard file
             type  if  they indicate different languages.  If no compiler
             is indicated with either a switch or a standard  file  type,
             the FORTRAN compiler is used.

        Default Switches Not Passed to Compiler

             Only switches specified in a LOAD-class command  are  passed
             to  the compiler; default switches are not passed.  Instead,
             the system assumes that the defaults for  the  compiler  are
             the same as the defaults for the LOAD-class command.


   Hints

        Commas Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more filespecs  separated  by  commas  as
             arguments  to  LOAD,  the loaded programs exist in memory at
             the same time and will operate as a single program.  You can
             use  this feature to substitute one module for another under
             varying conditions or for different applications.

        Plus Signs Between Filespecs

             If you give two or more source filespecs separated  by  plus
             signs  (+)  as arguments to LOAD, they are compiled together
             as if they were a  single  file.   Their  object  module  is
             stored  under any filename given as the "object" argument of
             the command, or (if none) under the  last  filename  in  the
             group and file type .REL.

        Indirect Files as Arguments

             You  can  store  arguments  (source  and  object  filespecs,
             switches) of a LOAD command in an indirect file, and specify
             them by typing an at sign (@) and its  filespec  as  a  LOAD
             command argument.

        Establishing Default Arguments with the SET Command

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                   §textbf[(LOAD)]


             You can issue the SET DEFAULT  COMPILE-SWITCHES  command  to
             set up default global arguments to the LOAD command.  Insert
             this SET command in your COMAND.CMD file to change your  own
             defaults permanently.

        Running Link Directly

             The LOAD  command  automatically  runs  LINK,  the  system's
             linking  loader,  but  if  you  require  more control of the
             loading process you can run LINK directly.  See the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[LINK] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].

        Using GET Instead of LOAD

             If you have used the SAVE command to save your  programs  in
             executable  format,  you  can use the GET command instead of
             LOAD to place them in memory.  This is  a  faster  and  less
             expensive means of loading programs into memory.

        Wildcards Illegal with LOAD

             The LOAD command does not accept wildcard characters (*  and
             %) in a file specification.


   Warning - Generation Numbers, Long Filespecs

        You must not give generation numbers when  specifying  source  or
        object   files;   the   system  automatically  uses  the  highest
        generation.  Also, most compilers require filenames of 6 or fewer
        characters and file types of 3 or fewer characters.

   §textbf[2.48]  §textbf[LOGIN]

   Begins your timesharing job and connects you to your log-in directory.


   Format

        @§textbf[LOGIN] /FAST (USER) §textbf[name] (PASSWORD) §textbf[password] (ACCOUNT)§textbf[account] §textbf[-]
        (SESSION REMARK) §textbf[remark]

        where:

        name         is your user name.

        pwd          is your secret password (which  is  not  printed  on
                     your terminal).

        acc          is an account name or number that you are authorized
                     to use.

        remark       is an optional remark of up to  39  characters  that
                     identifies   the  terminal  session  for  accounting
                     purposes.   Check   with   INFORMATION   JOB-STATUS.
                     Change with SET SESSION-REMARK.

        /FAST        is an optional switch that prevents  the  following:
                     processing  of  your  LOGIN.CMD and COMAND.CMD files
                     and the system's  LOGIN.CMD  and  COMAND.CMD  files,
                     printing  of system mail, and printing of the notice
                     of new mail.  (Your system manager may  remove  this
                     switch from your system.)


   Output

        Acknowledgement of Valid Login

             The system acknowledges a valid LOGIN  command  by  printing
             your  job  number, terminal number, and the current date and
             time.  In addition, it prints the date and time of your last
             login.  You can use this information to determine if another
             user has learned your password and logged in to your account
             since the last time you logged out.

             Note that a batch job automatically logs in and logs out  of
             your  account.   The  batch  login sets the date and time of
             your last login and should  not  be  confused  with  illegal
             access to your account.

        Notice of User Mail and System Mail



                                   2-229

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(LOGIN)]


             When you log in, the system notifies you if another user has
             sent  you  a  message  with one of the system mail programs.
             The  system  then  lists  any  system  mail  (mail  sent  by
             privileged  users  to  all users) that has accumulated since
             your last login.  Note that this mail  appears  in  the  log
             file if a batch job is run for you between the time the mail
             was sent and the time you logged in.

        Output from Command Files

             After a successful LOGIN, the system processes the LOGIN.CMD
             and  COMAND.CMD  files  in  the directory defined by logical
             name SYSTEM:  and the command files in your login directory.
             The files are processed in this order:

                  1.  SYSTEM:LOGIN.CMD
                  2.  LOGIN.CMD
                  3.  SYSTEM:COMAND.CMD
                  4.  COMAND.CMD

             The system displays any output from the  commands  in  these
             files  on  your  terminal.   After execution of each command
             file,   the   system   displays   the   message   "End    of
             file-name.CMD".   If the last command in the command file is
             a TAKE command  with  no  arguments,  this  message  is  not
             displayed.


   Characteristics

        Getting the Attention of the System

             Before logging in, you may have to press any alphanumeric or
             special  character  to display the system herald or greeting
             and the @ prompt necessary for typing the LOGIN command.

             If you are dialing  in  by  telephone  to  a  line  declared
             autobaud  by  the  system  manager,  this  initial character
             enables  the  system  to  determine  your  terminal's  speed
             setting,  as  long  as  the  speed is 300, 1200, 1800, 2400,
             4800, or 9600.  Type a second character  if  the  terminal's
             speed  is 110 or 150.  If your initial character(s) fails to
             get the system identification message, press the  BREAK  key
             twice, followed by another character(s).

        Rights, Capabilities, and Charges

             The LOGIN command gives you ownership rights to your  log-in
             directory,  and  any group rights established for you on the
             public structure (usually named PS:).  In addition, you  are
             granted  whatever  capabilities  (for  example, Maintenance,

             Wheel)  have been awarded to you, and can be sure  that  any
             charges  you  incur for the use of system resources, such as
             CPU time or the batch and printing systems, will be recorded
             to your user name.


   Hints

        Commands in Files Executed at Log-in Time

             For Affecting Entire Session or Current Level Only

                  Commands that affect  your  entire  job,  for  example,
                  TERMINAL  and  DEFINE,  belong  in LOGIN.CMD.  Commands
                  that affect only the  current  level  of  TOPS-20,  for
                  example, many SET commands, must be put into COMAND.CMD
                  if you want them to  be  executed  automatically  after
                  every PUSH command as well as after LOGIN.

             For Affecting Batch Jobs

                  As soon as one of your batch jobs logs in,  the  system
                  processes the command files in the directory defined by
                  logical name SYSTEM:  and the  command  files  in  your
                  login  directory.   The  files  are  processed  in this
                  order:

                       1.  SYSTEM:BATCH.CMD
                       2.  BATCH.CMD
                       3.  SYSTEM:COMAND.CMD
                       4.  COMAND.CMD

                  Note that certain parameters  of  the  batch  job,  for
                  example,  its  time limit and the name of its log file,
                  have  already  been  set  before  these  commands   are
                  executed.   Such  parameters  are  set either to values
                  specified by switches in the SUBMIT command that starts
                  the  batch  job, or to default values in effect for the
                  job issuing this SUBMIT command.  See also  Hints - For
                  Affecting Nested Batch Jobs, below.

             Avoiding Duplicate Commands in Command Files

                  After executing a SYSTEM:   command  file,  the  system
                  executes  the  file  of  the  same  name  in your login
                  directory.  The  SYSTEM:   command  files  may  contain
                  commands  that  you  already  have  in your own command
                  files.  To avoid executing  the  same  commands  twice,
                  remove  duplicate commands from your command files.  To
                  display a SYSTEM:  command file, give the command  TYPE
                  SYSTEM:file-name.CMD.

                                  §textbf[(LOGIN)]


             For Affecting Nested Batch Jobs

                  By  placing  a  SET  DEFAULT  SUBMIT  command  in  your
                  BATCH.CMD  file,  you  cause  these  defaults  to be in
                  effect for a nested batch job, (a batch job started  by
                  a  SUBMIT command within the control file of another of
                  your batch jobs).

             A Final TAKE Command

                  To  suppress  the  display  of  the  message  "End   of
                  file-name.CMD"  after execution of a command file, make
                  the last command in the file a  TAKE  command  with  no
                  arguments.

             Simplifying Log-ins

                  By using the SET DIRECTORY ACCOUNT-DEFAULT command  you
                  cause  subsequent  LOGIN  commands to require just your
                  user name and password.


   Special Cases

        Commands You Can Issue Before Log-in

             You can give these commands and arguments before logging in:

             Command                  Arguments

             ATTACH
             BREAK

             TERMINAL
             UNATTACH

        Logging in to PTYs

             You do not need to give a password  when  logging  in  under
             your own user name to a PTY (pseudo-terminal).

        Must Log In Within Five Minutes

                                  §textbf[(LOGIN)]


             If you do not log in within five  minutes  of  your  initial
             CTRL/C,  your  job  will be logged out automatically and you
             will have to type CTRL/C again.

        Logging in to Last Available Job Slot

             If you attempt to log in to the last available job slot, the
             system  will  not  log  you  in  but  will send you an error
             message instead.  This job slot is intended  for  users  who
             wish  to  attach detached jobs using the ATTACH command.  To
             log in a new job you must wait until  a  current  user  logs
             out.

        where:

        /FAST is an optional switch  that  prevents  processing  of  your
              LOGOUT.CMD and the system's LOGOUT.CMD files.

        n     is an optional job number.  Specify n only when logging out
              a job other than your attached job.


   Output

        System Use Under Current Account

             The system acknowledges a valid LOGOUT command  by  printing
             your  job  number,  user  name,  current  account,  terminal
             number, and the current date and time.  Then  it  shows  the
             total  amount  of  CPU  time  you  used  during the terminal
             session and the total length of time  you  were  logged  in,
             followed  by  the account of CPU time used under the current
             account and the length of time you were logged in under this
             account.

        LOGOUT.CMD Output

             Before logging you out, the system processes the commands in
             your  login  directory's  LOGOUT.CMD  file  and the system's
             LOGOUT.CMD file and displays any output from these commands.
             Then,  after execution of each file, the system displays the
             message "End of LOGOUT.CMD", unless the last command in  the
             file is a TAKE command.


   Characteristics

        Expunging Your Log-in and Connected Directories

             Before logging you out,  the  system  expunges  any  deleted
             files from your log-in and connected directories, and prints
             a  message  if  either  directory  is  still  exceeding  its
             assigned permanent disk quota.

                                  §textbf[(LOGOUT)]


             By specifying a job number you can log  out  any  other  job
             logged  in under the same user name as your attached job.  A
             user with Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled can log out
             any  job  on  the system.  Whenever you log out another job,
             the system prints the job's user name, terminal number,  and
             current  program.   You must then confirm the LOGOUT command
             with an extra RETURN.

             When a job is logged out by another job, the logout  command
             files are not processed.


   Hints

        A Final TAKE Command

             To suppress the display of the message "End  of  LOGOUT.CMD"
             after  execution  of  your  LOGOUT.CMD  file,  make the last
             command in the file a TAKE command with  no  arguments.   Be
             sure  the  file  contains  only  one  RETURN  after the TAKE
             command.

        Errors in LOGOUT.CMD

             If there is an error in a command in your  LOGOUT.CMD  file,
             the system processes the commands up to the one in error and
             cancels the LOGOUT command.  To log out, correct  the  error
             in  the  command  file  or  give the LOGOUT command with the
             /FAST switch.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The LOGOUT command clears memory and leaves your terminal in  the
        state  before log-in.  LOGOUT n does not affect memory and leaves
        your terminal at TOPS-20 command level.

        2.  Log out your job,  receiving  a  warning  message  that  your
            directory is over its storage quota.

            @§uline[LOGOUT]
             <URQUHART> Over permanent storage allocation by 8 page(s).

        3.  Check what jobs are logged in under your user name.  Log  out
            a  detached job and verify that it is gone, then log out your
            attached job.

                                  §textbf[(MERGE)]


   §textbf[2.50]  §textbf[MERGE]

   Places an executable program into the current fork, combining it  with
   whatever program (if any) is already there.


   Format

        @§textbf[MERGE] (PROGRAM) §textbf[filespec] §textbf[/switch]

        where:

        filespec     is the file specification of any executable program.
                          §textbf[Default] file type - .EXE

        /switch      is one or more of the following:

                          /OVERLAY       allows pages of the DDT  program
                                         to be loaded over pages occupied
                                         by  the  existing   program   in
                                         memory.

                          /USE-SECTION:n
                                         specifies  the  memory   section
                                         (from  0 to 37 octal) into which
                                         your program is  to  be  merged.
                                         You  can use this switch only if
                                         your program can be contained in
                                         one section.


   Characteristics

        Executable Files Only

             If a program you try to merge is not in  executable  format,
             you   may   get   an   immediate  error  message  (that  is,
             "?UNEXPECTED END-OF-FILE TRAP...") or a  delayed  one  (that
             is,  "?ENTRY VECTOR LENGTH IS NOT LESS THAN 1000") after the
             merge.  In either case, be sure that you have  specified  an
             executable  program before investigating further.  The MERGE
             command does not alter the entry vector if  the  file  being
             merged is in the proper .EXE format.

        Existing Pages Not Overlaid

             If there is a program already in memory when  you  give  the
             MERGE  command, and pages of the new program overlay it, the
             new program is not placed into memory, and the system prints
             the  error message, "?Illegal to overlay existing pages." To
             force the existing pages to be overlaid, reissue  the  MERGE

             command using the /OVERLAY switch.


   Effect on Memory

        The MERGE command combines the specified program with the program
        in  the  current  fork.   It  does not affect the contents of the
        current fork unless you specify the /OVERLAY switch.

   Characteristics

        MODIFY Effective Only Before Processing

             The MODIFY command affects a batch or  output  request  only
             before  processing  has  begun.  After processing has begun,
             you can only cancel the request with the CANCEL command, and
             then make a new request.


   Hints

        Using the /DEPENDENCY-COUNT Switch

             You can use the  /DEPENDENCY-COUNT  switch  to  specify  the
             order  in  which  your  batch  jobs  are processed.  Set the
             dependency count of all but the first job to  some  positive
             value  when  you submit them, and include MODIFY commands in
             each job's control file to bring the next  job's  dependency
             count to 0 at the appropriate time.  See Example 4.


   Special Cases

        /JOBNAME Switch

             In the singular case when you want to modify  several  queue
             requests  of  the  same  jobname using only one command, and
             that jobname is purely numerical (for  example,  5045),  you
             must  use  the /JOBNAME:jobname switch as second argument to
             the MODIFY command.  Do not also  give  the  request  ID  or
             jobname   as   a   command   argument   if   you   give  the
             /JOBNAME:jobname switch.

                                      has full access to  his  tapes,  so
                                      the  first  two  digits  are always
                                      interpreted  as  "77";  also,  user
                                      groups and directory groups have no
                                      effect  on  tape  access,  so   the

                                      specified, only the last two digits
                                      affect the tape's protection code.

                                      (If you specify  only  two  digits,
                                      these  will be used as the last two
                                      digits  of  the  protection  code.)
                                      These  two digits should be the sum

   Characteristics

        Action of MOUNT STRUCTURE Command

             If the Structure Has Already Been Mounted

                  If the structure for which you give the  MOUNT  command
                  is  currently mounted, the system simply increases by 1
                  the mount count (the number of users who have given the
                  MOUNT  but not the DISMOUNT command for the structure),
                  and returns your terminal to TOPS-20 command level.   A
                  structure  is not ordinarily dismounted until its mount
                  count is 0.

             If the Structure Has Not Yet Been Mounted

                  If the structure for which you give the  MOUNT  command
                  is  not  currently  mounted,  your request stays in the
                  mount request queue until  it  is  acted  upon  by  the
                  operator or until you cancel the request.

        Setnames (File Set Identifiers)

             The setname, or file set identifier of a set  of  tapes,  is
             part  of  the  label information written into each volume of
             the set.  It is rewritten every time the  /NEW  or  /SCRATCH
             switch  is included in a MOUNT command.  The "dev:" argument
             of the MOUNT command becomes the setname in this  case.   If
             you add volumes to an existing tape set, the system uses the
             setname of the old volumes as the setname of the new ones.

             Using the /CHECK-SETNAME Switch

                  If you give the MOUNT command to use an  existing  file
                  set  (you  do not specify the /NEW or /SCRATCH switch),
                  you can give the /CHECK-SETNAME switch to be sure  that
                  the  setname  written  on the tapes matches the setname
                  you  specify  as  the  "dev:"  argument  to  the  MOUNT

                  command.   However,  because more than one set of tapes
                  can have the same setname,  the  /CHECK-SETNAME  switch
                  does  not  ensure  that  the  correct  tape set will be
                  mounted.   For  information  about  ensuring  that  the
                  correct  tapes are mounted, see Characteristics - Using
                  the /VOLIDS Switch, below.

        Volids (Volume Identifiers)

             The volid, or  volume  identifier  of  a  volume  (reel)  of
             labeled  tape, is part of the label information written into
             each volume of tape.   It  is  written  only  once,  by  the
             operator  during the tape's initialization procedure, and is
             not changed during the life of the tape.  (You  should  also
             affix  a  paper label displaying the volid onto each reel of
             tape.) You can get a list of volids for previously specified
             or  newly  written volumes in any mounted tape set by giving
             the INFORMATION VOLUMES command for that set.

             Using the /VOLIDS Switch

                  If you give  the  MOUNT  command  to  use  an  existing
                  multi-volume  tape set (you do not specify the /SCRATCH
                  switch), you can give the volid of each volume you want
                  to  use  as  an  argument  to  the /VOLIDS switch.  The
                  system ensures that the correct volumes  of  a  labeled
                  tape  will  be  mounted for your job as long as you use
                  the /VOLIDS switch to specify them.  (If the  tape  set
                  does  not consist of labeled tapes, the system does not
                  ensure that the correct tapes are mounted.)

                  The volids must represent consecutive volumes and  must
                  be specified in the order written (oldest first).  Note
                  that  in  general  you  cannot  rely  on  any  apparent
                  alphanumerical  order  when  specifying  the volids but
                  must maintain your own list of the volids in each  tape
                  set.  (See Hints - Keeping Track of Volids, below.) You
                  need not specify every volid in the tape set,  but any
                  volume not specified will not be accessible through the
                  current  MOUNT  command.   See  also  Characteristics -
                  Using   the   /OPERATOR  Switch,  and  Special  Cases -
                  Single-volume Tape Sets, below.

             Using the /OPERATOR Switch

                  You can use the /OPERATOR switch instead of the /VOLIDS
                  switch  when  asking the system to mount a multi-volume
                  set of tapes.  The /OPERATOR switch sends a message  to
                  the  operator  asking  him to specify the volid of each
                  volume  himself.   You  must  be  sure  to  supply  the
                  operator  with  a  list  of  the volids you want him to

                                  §textbf[(MOUNT)]


                  specify before giving a MOUNT command that contains the
                  /OPERATOR switch.


   Hints

        Checking Whether Operator is Present

             You can give the INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS command  to  find
             out  whether  the  operator is in attendance and can process
             your  mount  request.   Even  if  the  operator  is  not  in
             attendance,  your request remains valid until he returns and
             deals with it in some way.

        Using the /STRUCTURE-ID Switch

             The /STRUCTURE-ID  switch  (available  only  to  users  with
             enabled  WHEEL  or  OPERATOR capabilities) gives the name of
             the structure as recorded in the disk(s)  of  the  structure
             itself,  where  it is used by the system for identification.
             Be sure that the structure identification  is  also  written
             with  a  felt-tip  marker  on the upper surface of each disk
             pack, and on a gummed label on the pack cover.

             Unless you give this switch, the system mounts the structure
             with  its  structure identification as alias.  (The alias is
             the name you use  when  specifying  the  structure  in  file
             specifications  and  commands; the INFORMATION STRUCTURE and
             INFORMATION AVAILABLE DEVICES commands  list  structures  by
             alias  only.)  The  /STRUCTURE-ID  switch  allows an enabled
             WHEEL  or  OPERATOR  to  mount  a  structure  under  a  name
             different from the one recorded in the structure.

             Use this switch for mounting  a  structure  whose  structure
             identification  is  the  same  as  the  alias of a currently
             mounted structure.  In such cases give the  MOUNT  STRUCTURE
             command  with  any  unique alias as the "dev:" argument, and
             specify the structure identification with the  /STRUCTURE-ID
             switch.   In  subsequent  file  specifications  and commands
             referring to the structure, use the alias only.

        Dummy "dev:" Arguments for Mounting Tapes

             If you  want  to  use  different  tape  sets  on  successive
             runnings  of  a  single program, you can refer to those tape
             sets as a logical name in the program, and use this  logical
             name  as  the  "dev:"  argument  of  your MOUNT command when
             mounting tapes.  As long as you also specify  the  volid  of
             each  volume  of  tape  with  the /VOLIDS switch (or use the
             /OPERATOR switch to ask the operator to do so), you need not
             give  the  actual  setname  of  the  tape  set as the "dev:"


                                   2-260

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(MOUNT)]


             argument to the MOUNT command.   The  system  considers  the
             "dev:"  argument  you supply to be a logical name defined as
             the mounted tape set.  Therefore, your  program  can  access
             the tape set using this logical name.

        Keeping Track of Volids

             Unless your site has a tape cataloging  facility,  you  must
             keep  your  own  record  of  the volids in each of your tape
             sets.  After creating a file set on a new tape set, i.e, one
             not previously owned by you (by giving the MOUNT command and
             including  the  /SCRATCH  switch),  you  should   give   the
             INFORMATION  VOLUMES  command  for the set before giving the
             DISMOUNT command.  The system will  respond  by  printing  a
             list  at  your  terminal of the volids of all volumes in the
             tape set.  Similarly, if you mount an old tape set and  then
             perform   write  operations,  you  should  give  INFORMATION
             VOLUMES before giving DISMOUNT to learn the  volids  of  any
             volumes  added  to  the  set.  Keep an ordered list of these
             volids in  a  disk  file  in  your  directory,  for  use  in
             subsequent MOUNT commands when you give the /VOLIDS switch.


   Special Cases

        Single-volume Tape Sets

             If the tape set you want  to  mount  consists  of  a  single
             volume  of  tape, you need not give the /VOLIDS or /OPERATOR
             switch to specify its volid.  You can give the volid as  the
             "dev:" argument to the MOUNT command.

        Structures Unavailable for Mounting

             If the operator has  given  the  OPR  program  command,  SET
             STRUCTURE  UNAVAILABLE for a specified structure, the system
             sends an error  message  including  the  phrase,  "Structure
             unavailable  for  mounting"  in response to subsequent MOUNT
             commands for the structure.


   Restrictions

        Using SET TAPE Commands

             The TOPS-20 SET TAPE DENSITY and SET  TAPE  PARITY  commands
             are  applicable  to  unlabeled  tapes  only  (but  see  also
             Warnings - /DENSITY Switch Has Limited Effect for  Unlabeled
             Tapes,   below).    The   SET   TAPE  FORMAT  and  SET  TAPE
             RECORD-LENGTH commands are applicable to  both  labeled  and
             unlabeled  tapes,  but  to  labeled  tapes  only if they are

                                  §textbf[(MOUNT)]


             mounted using the  /LABEL-TYPE:ANSI  or  /LABEL-TYPE:TOPS-20
             switch.   In addition, the files that you read from or write
             to such a labeled tape must be in 36-bit  format,  and  they
             must  not  have  the  ;FORMAT  attribute  as  part  of their
             specification.


   Warnings

        POP Command Cancels Unsatisfied Mount Requests

             If you have given a PUSH command to obtain a  new  level  of
             TOPS-20 and then give a MOUNT command within that new level,
             a subsequent POP command will  cancel  your  mount  request.
             However,  if the specified structure or tape set has already
             been mounted,  it  will  remain  mounted  despite  your  POP
             command.

        /DENSITY Switch Has Limited Effect for Unlabeled Tapes

             The /DENSITY switch, when given in a MOUNT  command  for  an
             unlabeled  tape,  ensures  only  that  your tape set will be
             mounted on a drive that supports the specified density.   It
             does not ensure that the tape set will be read or written at
             this density.  To specify the  density  at  which  unlabeled
             tapes  are to be read and written, give the SET TAPE DENSITY
             command.


   Effect on Terminal

        The MOUNT command with the /NOWAIT switch, leaves  your  terminal
        at  TOPS-20  command  level.   If  you have not given the /NOWAIT
        switch, your terminal waits until the system has  processed  your
        request, or to return to TOPS-20 command level.  This CTRL/C does
        not cancel your request.

   §textbf[2.53]  §textbf[PERUSE]

   Allows you to read a file using read-only editor commands.


   Format

        @§textbf[PERUSE] (FILE) §textbf[/switch(es)] §textbf[filespec]

        where:

        /switch(es)    are keywords that apply to the EDIT  editor.   For
                       descriptions of these switches, see the /CREATE or
                       EDIT commands.

        filespec       is the name of the file you want to read.
                            §textbf[Default] - the  last  file  specification  and
                                      associated  switches  you gave in a
                                      CREATE,  EDIT,  or  PERUSE  command
                                      during the current terminal session


   Characteristics

        The PERUSE command runs the  EDIT  system  program  in  read-only
        mode.   (However,  see Special Cases - Using an Editor Other than
        EDIT, below.) PERUSE is actually the same as the  EDIT  /READONLY
        command.   In  EDIT  /READONLY mode you can use only EDIT program
        switches and commands that do not modify the file.


   Hints

        Avoid Accidental File Modification

             Use PERUSE when  it  is  important  to  avoid  the  risk  of
             accidentally modifying a file.

        PERUSE Line in SWITCH.INI

             Add a line to your SWITCH.INI file for use with  the  PERUSE
             command.  (See Example 3.)


   Special Cases

        Using an Editor Other than EDIT

             The CREATE, EDIT and PERUSE commands in this  manual  assume
             that  these  commands call on the program EDIT.  If your job
             uses another editing program, for example, EDT, the switches


                                   2-269

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(PERUSE)]


             and examples shown here will not be applicable.

             The Editor used by the CREATE, EDIT and PERUSE  commands  is
             specified by the logical name EDITOR:.  You can find out the
             name of this program  by  giving  the  command,  INFORMATION
             LOGICAL-NAMES  EDITOR:.   The  job-wide  definition (if any)
             will be given first, followed by the system-wide definition;
             the  job-wide  definition  prevails  if  both exist.  If the
             definition of EDITOR:  is SYS:EDIT.EXE, the CREATE, EDIT and
             PERUSE  commands  will function as described in this manual.
             Otherwise, you must  consult  the  appropriate  manual  (for
             example, the §uline[EDT-20] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual]) for information.


   Restrictions

        Listing Available EDIT Read-Only Switches and Commands

             Many of the EDIT switches and commands that are displayed in
             response  to  a  ?  modify the file and do not function with
             PERUSE.  If you give a file-modifying switch, the switch  is
             ignored  but  no  error message is displayed.  If you give a
             file-modifying  EDIT  command,  you  receive   the   message
             %ILLEGAL COMMAND.

             For further information on these switches and  commands  see
             the §uline[EDIT] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].


   Effect on Memory

        The PERUSE command clears any  unkept  forks  from  memory,  then
        loads your edit program.


   Related Commands

        CREATE                        for creating new files

        DIRECTORY-class commands      for getting lists of existing files

        EDIT                          for modifying files

                       indicating  your  choice  of PLOT command options.
                       These switches are of two kinds:  job switches and
                       file switches.

                       Job switches apply to all files specified  in  the
                       command, no matter where you give the switches.

                       File switches have different effects depending  on
                       their  positions  in  the  command  line:   placed
                       before all files  in  the  command,  they  act  as
                       defaults  for  all; otherwise they affect only the
                       nearest preceding file.

        filespec       is the specification of a file you wish  to  plot.

                                      Alternatively, you can give  a  day
                                      of  the  week  (such  as MONDAY) or
                                      TODAY as  argument;  then  the  job
                                      will   not  be  plotted  until  the
                                      beginning of the following day.  If
                                      you  follow  this  argument  with a

   Characteristics

        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PLOT command with  just  a
             series of filespecs for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Hints

        Using SET DEFAULT PLOT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  PLOT,  give the SET DEFAULT PLOT command to establish
             them as defaults (at the current TOPS-20 command level)  for
             the  remainder  of your terminal session.  The switches will
             then behave as if you had  typed  them  directly  after  the
             command  name.   You  can  supersede  any  of  these default
             switches by actually  supplying  the  switch,  with  another
             value, when you give the PLOT command.  Put SET DEFAULT PLOT
             into a file  of  specification  COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in
             directory if you want these default switches to be in effect
             for all levels of future terminal sessions as well.


   Special Cases

        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PLOT  command.   This  causes any spooled
             output accumulated so far during your terminal session to be
             placed  in  a  plotter  queue  immediately,  rather  than at
             log-out time.  The/SPOOLED-OUTPUT switch is useful  only  if
             the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT  DEFERRED  command  is  in  effect.
             Programs that you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs)  may
             create  spooled output for the plotter, or you can create it
             directly by giving the command, COPY filespec PLT:.

   §textbf[2.55]  §textbf[POP]

   Terminates the current  level  of  TOPS-20  and  returns  you  to  its
   superior process.


   Format

        @§textbf[POP] (COMMAND LEVEL)


   Characteristics

        POP the Opposite of PUSH

             You can do one and only one POP command for  every  previous
             PUSH  command.   Giving  too many POP commands will cause an
             error message to be printed on your terminal.

        Job Parameters Affected by POP

             As soon as you complete a valid POP command at some level of
             TOPS-20,  you  give  up the copy of memory for that level of
             TOPS-20 and any program  you  were  running.   Any  defaults
             established  at  that  level  (such as default filespecs for
             LOAD-class and EDIT-class commands,  defaults  specified  by
             SET DEFAULT commands) are cancelled as well.  If POP returns
             you to a higher  level  of  TOPS-20,  all  these  parameters
             revert to any values established at that higher level.


   Special Cases

        Returning to Other Programs With POP

             The POP command usually returns you to the level of  TOPS-20
             from  which  you  gave  a  previous PUSH command.  But a few
             system programs such as PTYCON and OPR, also  allow  you  to
             give  PUSH  to  get  a new level of TOPS-20.  Giving the POP
             command to  this  level  of  TOPS-20  returns  you  to  that
             program.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The POP command clears memory, terminates the  current  level  of
        TOPS-20,  and  returns  your  terminal  to  the  previous TOPS-20
        command level (but see Special Cases,  above).   Memory  for  the
        previous TOPS-20 command level is not affected by this action.

   Examples

        1.  Give the POP command to return  to  a  higher  level  of  the
            TOPS-20 command processor (EXEC).

            @§uline[POP]

        2.  Run a program and halt it with CTRL/Cs.  Give a CONTINUE STAY
            command  to  resume  its execution, and then the PUSH command
            for a new level of TOPS-20.   Run  another  program  at  this
            lower  level, then use the POP command to return to the first
            level; in this case you return  before  receiving  the  final
            message of the first program.

                     switches are of two kinds:  job  switches  and  file

                     File switches have different  effects  depending  on
                     their  positions in the command file:  placed before
                     all files in the command, they act as  defaults  for
                     all;   otherwise   they   affect  only  the  nearest
                     preceding file.

                                    local and cluster printers.

        /DESTINATION-NODE:node-name
                                    specifies the remote  node  on  whose
                                    line  printer  your  request is to be
                                    printed.   The  remote  node  can  be
                                    either  an IBM remote station, a node
                                    in a TOPS-20 cluster,  a  DQS  server
                                    node,  or LATserver.  Two colons (::)
                                    following the node name are optional.
                                    You  can  use  this  switch either to
                                    send output to a remote  node  or  to
                                    redirect it from a remote node.

        /FORMS:forms name           specifies,   in    six    or    fewer
                                    characters,  the  forms  (determining

                                    use for the printing job.  Using this
                                    switch may delay processing until the
                                    operator can mount the proper  forms.
                                    Note   that   your  installation  may
                                    provide a different default  argument
                                    to this switch.

   Output

        Jobname, Request ID, Limit, Number of Files

             As soon as you complete a valid PRINT  command,  the  system
             responds  by  printing,  on  your terminal, the jobname, the
             node name (if printed on remote node),  request  ID  number,
             the  limit  in  pages of output assigned to the request, and
             the number of files in the request.


   Characteristics

        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PRINT command with just  a
             series of filespecs for arguments.

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Restrictions

        Using /UNIT, /REMOTE-PRINTER, and /CHARACTERISTICS

             You must use the /CHARACTERISTICS switch in conjunction with
             the  /REMOTE-PRINTER  switch  and not with the /UNIT switch,
             which applies only to local and cluster  printers.   If  you
             use the /UNIT switch in conjunction with the /REMOTE-PRINTER
             switch, it  is  ignored.   The  /CHARACTERISTICS  switch  is
             ignored if used in a local or cluster print job.

                                  §textbf[(PRINT)]


                                         NOTE

                 The  /CHARACTERISTICS  switch  does  not  apply   to
                 LATprinters.


   Hints

        Using SET DEFAULT PRINT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using PRINT, give the SET DEFAULT PRINT command to establish
             them as defaults (at the current TOPS-20 command level)  for
             the  remainder  of your terminal session.  The switches will
             then behave as if you had  typed  them  directly  after  the
             command  name.   You  can  supersede  any  of  these default
             switches by actually  supplying  the  switch,  with  another
             value,  when  you  give  the PRINT command.  Put SET DEFAULT
             PRINT into a file of specification COMAND.CMD in your log-in
             directory if you want these default switches to be in effect
             for all levels of future terminal sessions as well.


   Special Cases

        /SPOOLED-OUTPUT Switch

             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PRINT  command.   This causes any spooled
             output accumulated so far during your terminal session to be
             placed  in  a line printer queue immediately, rather than at
             log-out time.  The /SPOOLED-OUTPUT switch is useful only  if
             the  SET  SPOOLED-OUTPUT  DEFERRED  command  is  in  effect.
             Programs that you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs)  may
             create  spooled output for the printer, or you can create it
             directly by writing to device LPT:  (by giving the  command,
             COPY filespec LPT:), or giving a CREF command.

        switches       are  keywords,  chosen  from   the   list   below,
                       indicating  your  choice of PUNCH command options.
                       These switches are of two kinds:  job switches and
                       file switches.

                       Job switches apply to all files specified  in  the
                       command, no matter where you give the switches.

                       File switches have different effects depending  on
                       their  positions  in  the  command  line:   placed
                       before all files  in  the  command,  they  act  as
                       defaults  for  all; otherwise they affect only the
                       nearest preceding file.

                            Defaults are shown in the list of switches

        filespec       is the specification of a file you wish to  punch.
                       You  can  use  wildcard  characters  (%  and *) to
                       specify more than one file.

                                 until   after   the   date  and/or  time
                                 specified.     NOV-12-79    and    18:00
                                 illustrate two arguments to this switch.
                                 If you give both date and time, separate
                                 them  with  a  space.  When given alone,
                                 the time may be preceded by a plus  sign
                                 (+),  which will delay processing by the
                                 indicated  length  of  time   from   the
                                 present.

                                 Alternatively, you can give a day of the
                                 week   (such  as  MONDAY)  or  TODAY  as
                                 argument;  then  the  job  will  not  be
                                 punched   until  the  beginning  of  the
                                 following  day.   If  you  follow   this
                                 argument  with  a  plus sign and a time,
                                 the job will be further delayed by  this
                                 amount.

        /DESTINATION-NODE:node-name
                                 specifies the IBM remote node  on  whose

                                 request is to be satisfied.  Two  colons

                                 optional.

        /FORMS:forms name        specifies, in six or  fewer  characters,
                                 the  forms  (determining  the weight and
                                 color of card or paper stock,  the  size

                                 etc.)  to  use  for  the  punching  job.
                                 Using  this  switch may delay processing
                                 until the operator can mount the  proper

   Output

        Jobname, Request ID, Limit, Number of Input Files

             As soon as you complete a valid PUNCH  command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID number, the output limit in number of cards  or  feet  of
             paper  tape assigned to the request, and the number of input
             files in the request.


   Characteristics

        Ordinary Operation - No Switches

             For most purposes you can use the PUNCH  command  with  just

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of those default settings.  The switches most  commonly
             affected  are:   /FORMS,  /HEADER and /NOHEADER, /LIMIT, and
             /PRIORITY.


   Hints

        Using the SET DEFAULT Commands

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  PUNCH,  give  the  SET  DEFAULT  CARDS or SET DEFAULT
             PAPER-TAPE command to establish them  as  defaults  (at  the
             current  TOPS-20  command  level)  for the remainder of your
             terminal session.  The switches will then behave as  if  you
             had  typed  them  directly  after the command name.  You can
             supersede  any  of  these  default  switches   by   actually
             supplying  the switch, with another value, when you give the
             PUNCH command.  Put SET DEFAULT  commands  into  a  file  of
             specification  COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in directory if you
             want these default switches to be in effect for  all  levels
             of future terminal sessions as well.

                                  §textbf[(PUNCH)]


             You can give the special switch,  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT,  as  sole
             argument  to  the  PUNCH  CARDS or PUNCH PAPER-TAPE command.
             This causes any spooled output  accumulated  so  far  during
             your  terminal session to be placed in a card punch or paper
             tape punch queue immediately, rather than at  log-out  time.
             The  /SPOOLED-OUTPUT  switch  is  useful  only  if  the  SET
             SPOOLED-OUTPUT DEFERRED command is in effect.  Programs that
             you  run  (especially  FORTRAN  programs) may create spooled
             paper tape punch or card punch output.  Or you can create it
             directly  by giving the command, COPY filespec PTP:, or COPY
             filespec CDP:, respectively, or by giving a CREF command.

   §textbf[2.58]  §textbf[PUSH]

   Creates a new level of TOPS-20 inferior to the one from which you give
   the PUSH command.


   Format

        @§textbf[PUSH] (COMMAND LEVEL)


   Characteristics

        A New Level of TOPS-20

             The PUSH command creates an inferior level  of  the  TOPS-20
             command  processor  (EXEC).   The system's SYSTEM:COMAND.CMD
             file and your login directory's COMAND.CMD file are executed
             again,  you have a fresh copy of memory and can begin giving
             commands as if you had just logged  in.   However,  job-wide
             parameters (for example, connected and accessed directories,
             logical name definitions, most  parameters  altered  by  SET
             commands)  are  unaffected  by  the  PUSH command and retain
             their values.


   Hints

        Creating a Different Copy of an EXEC

             You can use the PUSH command to create an inferior level  of
             an  EXEC  of  your  choice.  Normally, PUSH creates the EXEC
             defined by the system logical name, DEFAULT-EXEC:.  Use  the
             DEFINE  command to define a job logical name, DEFAULT-EXEC:,
             with the name of the EXEC you want to create each  time  you
             PUSH.

             Note  that  many  TOPS-20  programs  have  their  own   PUSH
             commands.   However,  only  the  EXEC  and OPR PUSH commands
             refer to the job's definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:.

        Using CONTINUE STAY With PUSH

             You can use the PUSH command to run two programs at once  or
             to do other work that requires more than one copy of memory.
             Simply  use  the  CONTINUE  /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND
             command to continue execution of your current program before
             using PUSH.  After PUSH  you  can  run  another  program  or
             otherwise  alter  memory  without  affecting  memory for the
             first program.  See Example 2.  But see also Warning, below.

                                   §textbf[(PUSH)]


        Use of Multiforking Instead of PUSH

             The PUSH command allows you to run several programs at  once
             by  running  the  programs  at  different  EXEC levels.  The
             EXEC's multiforking  feature  allows  you  to  run  multiple
             programs at the same EXEC level.  Working from a single EXEC
             makes multiprogramming easier to monitor  and  manage.   For
             information  on  multiforking  see  the  KEEP command or the
             §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].


   Restrictions

        Number of Successive PUSH commands

             You can give as many pairs  of  PUSH  and  POP  commands  as
             necessary  to complete your task.  Although there is a limit
             to the number of times you  can  give  PUSH  without  giving
             intervening   POP  commands,  this  limit  is  large  enough
             (approximately 24, although smaller  for  a  heavily  loaded
             system) not to interfere with most applications.  There is a
             smaller limit (usually 5) on the number of  EXECs  that  can
             give Queue-class commands.

             Use the INFORMATION SUPERIORS  command  to  learn  how  many
             superior EXEC levels you have created.

        Invalid Definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:

             If you define DEFAULT-EXEC:  with the name of a  nonexistent
             EXEC,  (if,  for  example, you make a spelling error in your
             DEFINE  command),  the  PUSH  command  ignores   the   job's
             definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:  and creates the EXEC defined by
             the system definition.

        Withheld Log-out Capability

             You can usually log out from a lower level of  TOPS-20  than
             the   one  to  which  you  logged  in.   By  doing  so,  you
             simultaneously conclude all processes of your job.  However,
             if  a program  (such as, PTYCON)  has initialized a level of
             the TOPS-20  command  processor  but  has  withheld  log-out
             capability  from it, you must use the POP command, followed,
             if necessary, by a program command to exit from the  program
             and  return to a higher level of TOPS-20, before you can log
             out.

             If you  have  two  programs  running  at  once  after  using
             CONTINUE  /STAY  or  CONTINUE  /BACKGROUND and PUSH commands
             (see Hints, above) they may try to access the same files  at
             the  same  time.   Or,  TOPS-20  commands given at the lower
             level may be intercepted by a program running at the  higher
             level.   For  a  discussion  of these possibilities, see the
             Restrictions section of the CONTINUE command description.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The PUSH command preserves your present memory, gives you a fresh
        copy of memory, and leaves your terminal at a new TOPS-20 command
        level.


   Related Commands

        2.  Run a program, and give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command
            level.    Give  a  CONTINUE  /STAY  command  to  resume  this
            program's execution, and then a PUSH command for a  new  copy
            of  the TOPS-20 command language.  Repeat this process twice;
            now you have three programs running at once.  In  the  lowest
            (fourth)  level  of  your  job, begin editing a file.  (Note:
            when running more than one program in this way, be sure  that
            they  do  not  use  the  same compiler or the same data base;
            otherwise, competition among them could  cause  unpredictable
            situations to develop.)

                            be contained in one section.


   Characteristics

        Need for R Command

             Although in most cases you can run system programs by simply
             typing  the  program name in place of an EXEC command, the R
             command is necessary for running a program whose name is the
             same  as  an  EXEC  command  or  an abbreviation for an EXEC
             command.  For example, if your site  has  a  system  program
             named CONNECT, it must be run with the R command in order to
             distinguish it from the EXEC's CONNECT command.  If you have
             a system program named GE, it must be run with the R command
             to distinguish it from  the  GE  abbreviation  for  the  GET
             command.

        Cancels the Ephemeral Attribute

             If a system program has been set  ephemeral  by  the  system
             manager  or, you have given a SET PROGRAM EPHEMERAL command,
             you can  cancel  the  ephemeral  attribute  by  running  the
             program  with  the  R  command instead of typing the program
             name as an EXEC command.

             For more information on the  ephemeral  attribute,  see  the
             ERUN command.

   Hints

        Defining SYS:

             If you redefine logical name SYS:  to be different from  the
             system-wide  definition,  you  should  include  SYS:  in the
             search list if you want to use the R command to  run  system
             programs.    For   further   information,  see  the  section
             entitled, Redefining System Logical  Names,  in  the  DEFINE
             command description.


   Effect on Memory

        The R command clears any  unkept  forks,  places  in  memory  and
        starts the specified program.

                         RECEIVE Command Arguments


        ADVICE              allows  both  assistance  and   communication
                            links  initiated  by another user's ADVISE or
                            TALK command.

        LINK                allows  communication  links  established  by
                            another user's TALK command.

        SYSTEM-MESSAGES     allows notices of new mail  and  messages  of
                            interest to all users sent by the operator or
                            other privileged users.

        USER-MESSAGES       allows messages sent by another  user's  SEND
                            command.
                                 §textbf[Default] - LINKS, SYSTEM-MESSAGES, and
                                           USER-MESSAGES


   Hint

        Typing RECEIVE During Attempted TALK

             If your terminal has been set to refuse  links  and  another
             user  tries  to  talk to you by using the TALK command, both
             terminals will give a  series  of  CTRL/G  signals  (ringing
             bells or beeps) indicating the refused attempt.  If you give
             the RECEIVE LINKS command before these signals are finished,
             the TALK command will succeed.

   §textbf[2.61]  §textbf[REENTER]

   Starts the current fork at its alternate entry point.


   Format

        @§textbf[REENTER] (PROGRAM)


   Characteristics

        Using REENTER

             The REENTER command  starts  your  program  at  the  address
             specified  by the second word in the program's entry vector.
             For most programs this address is contained in location 124.
             Usually  the REENTER and START commands start the program at
             the same point, but another re-entry point can  be  provided
             to  avoid initialization procedures, perform error recovery,
             or to use the program in a different way.


   Hints

        Further Information

             For more information about entry vectors,  see  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[Monitor] §uline[Calls] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].

   Examples

        1.  Give the REENTER command for your current program.

            @§uline[REENTER]

        2.  Begin running a program, then give a CTRL/C to leave  it  and
            obtain  a  file.   Resume  execution  of  the  program at the
            alternate entry point.

        where:

        argument            is a keyword, chosen  from  the  list  below,
                            naming  the kind of communication you are not
                            willing to accept.

        ADVICE              prevents  assistance  initiated  by   another
                            user's ADVISE command.

                            user's ADVICE or TALK command.

        SYSTEM-MESSAGES     prevents notices of new mail and messages  of
                            general  interest  sent  to  all users by the
                            monitor  or  by   the   operator   or   other

                                 §textbf[Default] - ADVICE and LINKS


   Hints

        Refusing All Communication

             Users  with  Wheel  or  Operator  capabilities  enabled  can
             ADVISE,  SEND,  and  TALK  to  terminals  that  have refused
             advice, user-messages, and links.  To  refuse  messages  and
             links  from  privileged  users,  use  the  TERMINAL  INHIBIT
             command.

        Typing RECEIVE During Attempted TALK

             If your terminal has been set to refuse  links  and  another
             user  tries  to  talk to you by using the TALK command, both

                                  §textbf[(REFUSE)]


             terminals will give a  series  of  CTRL/G  signals  (ringing
             bells or beeps) indicating the refused attempt.  If you give
             the RECEIVE LINKS command before these signals are finished,
             the TALK command will succeed.

        Safeguarding Terminal Output

             If you want your terminal to  print  a  long  file,  without
             interference,  use  the  TERMINAL INHIBIT command to prevent
             all classes of message from being received.  Be sure to  use
             the  TERMINAL  NO  INHIBIT command afterwards to restore the
             previous condition of your terminal.


   Special Cases

        Implicit Refusal of Advice

             If you give the REFUSE LINKS command, your terminal will  be
             set   to  refuse  advice  also.   However,  the  INFORMATION
             TERMINAL-MODE command may not display  this  setting  unless
             you give an explicit REFUSE ADVICE command as well.

        Privileged Disregard of REFUSE

             A user with enabled Wheel or Operator capabilities can  give
             the TALK or ADVISE command for any job.

        2.  Receive a communication link formed by  another  user's  TALK
            command.   Confer with him briefly, then set your terminal to
            refuse all classes of message over which you have control.

        Type remark.  End with CTRL/Z.


   Characteristics

        Ending Remarks

             Until you give a CTRL/Z, the system merely displays what you
             type, instead of trying to interpret it as commands.


   Hints

        Useful During TALK or ADVISE Session

             If you have already established contact with another user by
             a  TALK or ADVISE command before giving REMARK, his terminal
             will also display what you type.  Give  the  REMARK  command
             before  sending  lengthy  comments or demonstrating commands
             that you don't want to take effect.

        Confirmation of Action

             As each file is renamed, the system prints its old  and  new
             specification, and the word §lbrack[]Superseding§rbrack[] if it is replacing
             previous contents, and finally the  word  §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[].   The  delay
             before  you  see  this  §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[]  indicates  how long it took to
             rename the file.


   Hints

        Specifying a New Account and Protection Number

             You can specify the new file's  protection  number  and  the
             account  to  which its storage fees will be charged.  Follow
             the new filespec with a  semicolon  (;)  and  the  letter  P
             before  giving  a  new 6-digit protection number, and with a

                                  §textbf[(RENAME)]


             semicolon and the letter A  before  giving  a  new  account.
             Ordinarily   these  values  are  set  to  the  default  file
             protection  and  current  account.    However,   non-default
             protection numbers will be maintained for higher generations
             of existing files,  unless  you  specify  otherwise  in  the
             RENAME command that creates that higher generation.

        RENAME Faster Than COPY for Transferring Files

             For moving a set of files from one directory to  another  on
             the  same structure, the RENAME command is a faster and more
             efficient means than COPY.   This  is  because  RENAME  only
             changes  the  file  specifications;  it  does  not  copy the
             contents of the files.   Also,  a  file  transfer  with  the
             RENAME  command  leaves  only  one  set  of  files,  while a
             transfer  with  the  COPY  command  leaves  two  sets:   the
             original  copies  and  the destination copies.  The original
             copies are often unnecessary and must be deleted.


   Restrictions

        Renaming Between Structures

             You cannot rename a file from one structure to another,  but
             must  use  the COPY command to reproduce its contents on the
             new structure, then the DELETE command to remove it from the
             old structure.

        Renaming Open or Mapped Files

             You cannot rename a file that is open or mapped into memory.
             First  give  the RESET command, or POP followed by RESET, if
             this is the case.

        Renaming Archived Files

             You can rename an archived file  by  specifying  it  as  the
             first  (or  old) argument of a RENAME command.  It will then
             have the second (or new) argument as its  specification  and
             will  remain an archived file.  However, you cannot give the
             specification of an archived file as the second argument  of
             a RENAME command, as this would replace the file's contents.
             If you attempt to do so, the file you specify as  the  first
             argument  will  be  renamed to a generation higher by 1 than
             the  highest  existing  generation  of  the  archived  file,
             leaving the archived file intact.

   Warning

        Replacing Previous Contents of Files

             If  you  rename  a  file  into  a  specification  (including
             generation   number)   that  already  exists,  the  previous
             contents  of  the  new  file  are  replaced  and  cannot  be
             recovered.   But see Restrictions - Renaming Archived Files,
             above.

   Characteristics

        Action of RESET

             In addition to clearing memory for the specified forks,  the
             RESET  command closes all files, mapped and unmapped, opened
             by the specified forks and their inferior forks.  RESET also
             simultaneously  terminates  the  specified  fork's  inferior
             forks.


   Effect on Memory

        The RESET command clears the specified forks from memory.

                              wildcard characters (% and *).


   Output

        Acknowledgment of Request

             As soon as you complete a valid RETRIEVE command, the system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the specification of
             each  off-line  file  for  which  you  requested  retrieval,
             followed by §lbrack[]OK§rbrack[].

        Notice of Retrieval Sent to Requestor

             Depending on the procedures at your site, when the files for
             which  you  have  requested  retrieval have been restored to
             their directory on disk, you may receive a mail message that
             contains  the  names of each retrieved file.  Remember that,
             depending on how frequently your  site  processes  retrieval
             requests,  this  message  may  not be sent until one or more
             days after your request.


   Characteristics

        Invisibility of Retrieved Files

             If you retrieve invisible files, they will remain  invisible
             (whether  archived  or  not) when restored to disk.  Use the
             SET FILE VISIBLE command to make  invisible  files  visible.
             Until  you  do so, they will be inaccessible to most TOPS-20
             commands.

   Hints

        Using Retrieved Archived Files

             As long as a retrieved archived file  is  visible,  you  can
             inspect  it  using  the  TYPE  or PRINT command, or list its
             specifications using DIRECTORY-class commands.  However, you
             cannot  add  to  it  or  change  it  (for  example, by using
             APPEND).  To make changes to a copy of a retrieved  archived
             file,  first  use  the  COPY  command  to  copy  it to a new
             specification.  If you wish, you can then  request  archival
             for this new file (using the ARCHIVE command) and delete the
             old  one  (using  the  DELETE  command  with  the   ARCHIVED
             subcommand).  You can return an (unchanged) on-line archived
             file to off-line status by using the DELETE command with the
             CONTENTS-ONLY  subcommand,  or  withdraw archive status from
             the file (make it  an  ordinary  disk  file)  by  using  the
             DISCARD command.

        Using Retrieved Non-archived Files

             As long as a retrieved non-archived file is visible, you can
             use  TOPS-20  commands  with it as with any other disk file.
             The only difference is  that  after  any  command  that  has
             changed  the  file,  the  tape copy of the file is no longer
             valid.  This means that you cannot give the  DELETE  command
             with  the  CONTENTS-ONLY  subcommand  to  return the file to
             off-line status.


   Special Cases

        Implied Retrieval Requests

             If your system has enabled  the  "automatic  retrieval-wait"
             feature  (give the INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS command to find
             out whether it has), and the SET RETRIEVAL-WAIT  command  is
             in  effect for your job, any command that attempts to use an
             off-line file will create an automatic retrieval request for
             that file.  Under these conditions, commands such as TYPE or
             COPY for which  you  specify  off-line  files  will  not  be
             executed until those files are retrieved.  Implied retrieval
             requests are most useful in batch jobs.

                                  §textbf[(REWIND)]


   §textbf[2.67]  §textbf[REWIND]

   Returns a magnetic tape to its  load  point  (logical  beginning,  the
   beginning of the first file).


   Format

        §textbf[@REWIND] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]  /switch

        where:

        dev:           is the name of the tape set or magnetic tape drive
                       that  you  want  to  rewind.   The colon after the
                       device name is optional.

        /switch        is one of the following:

                            /CURRENT-VOLUME-ONLY
                                           rewinds tape set to  beginning
                                           of currently mounted volume

                            /ENTIRE-VOLUME-SET

                                           of first volume
                                           §textbf[Default] - ENTIRE-VOLUME-SET

                              Note:   these switches can be used only for
                                      devices   of  the  form  MTn:,  not
                                      MTAn:.


   Restrictions

        REWIND with Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape  set  and you then give the REWIND
             command for that tape set, the system will first ask if  you
             want  to  close  the  associated  file.   You must do so for
             REWIND to succeed, but will probably be unable  to  continue
             the  program  from  that  point because the file will now be
             closed.

   §textbf[2.68]  §textbf[RUN]

   Places an executable program in memory and starts it.


   Format

        @§textbf[RUN] (PROGRAM) §textbf[filespec] §textbf[/switch]

        where:

        filespec       is  the  file  specification  of  any   executable
                       program.
                            §textbf[Default] dev:<dir> - DSK:

                            §textbf[Default] .typ - .EXE

        /switch        is /USE-SECTION:n
                            specifies the memory section (from  0  to  37
                            octal)  in which your program is to run.  You
                            can use this switch only if your program  can
                            be contained in one section.


   Characteristics

        Efficiency of RUN

             The RUN command does the work of the pair  of  commands  GET
             and  START.   It  is  a  faster  and less expensive means of
             executing programs than EXECUTE, or  than  LOAD  and  START.
             Therefore  you  should store frequently-run programs in .EXE
             files and run them with this command.


   Hints

        Alternative to RUN command

             When you type only a program name, the system  looks  for  a
             matching  system program.  When you precede the program name
             with the RUN command, the system looks for  the  program  in
             your connected directory.  The RUN command can be eliminated
             by typing the directory name with the program  name.   These
             two  commands  for  example,  each run SORTER located in the
             connected directory:

                  @RUN SORTER.EXE

                  @<SMITH>SORTER.EXE

                                   §textbf[(RUN)]


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The RUN command clears any unkept  forks,  places  the  specified
        program  in memory, starts it and leaves your terminal at command
        level in the program (if any), or at TOPS-20 command level.

                                          existing section


   Output

        Status of Files

             If you use recognition of the file specification, the system
             prints !Old Generation!, !New Generation!, or !New File!, to
             indicate its status on disk, or !OK!  if saved on a non-disk
             device.


   Hints

        Saving Programs Before Running Them

             When you load a source or  object  program  using  the  LOAD
             command, save it using SAVE before running it.  Then you can
             run it in the future using RUN,  without  first  loading  it
             using  a  LOAD-class command.  This is also true if you save
             the program after running it, but  it  will  then  be  in  a
             post-run state.

        More Information

             For more information about  saved  files,  see  the  §uline[TOPS-20]

   Restriction

        Saving an Execute-only Compiler

             It is illegal to use the SAVE command after using  the  LOAD
             command  for an execute-only compiler.  An alternative is to
             use LINK with the LOAD command and the /SAVE switch.

                     privileges.)

        message      is a message of up to six lines of text followed  by
                     a carriage return.

        switch       is /NODE:node-name

                     §uline[Language] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual]).


   Characteristics

        Multiple-line Messages

             SEND allows you to send multiple-line messages  with  up  to
             six  80-character  lines of text.  Type the message past the
             end of the first line and onto the next line without  typing
             RETURN.  SEND will reorganize your message on the receiver's
             terminal so that words broken across two lines appear on the
             same line.

        Refused SEND

             You cannot contact a user with SEND if his terminal  is  set
             to  refuse messages with the REFUSE USER-MESSAGES command or
             the TERMINAL INHIBIT command.  Normally, if you  attempt  to
             SEND  to  a  user  who has refused user messages, the system
             prints the message ?User is refusing messages and/or links.

                                   §textbf[(SEND)]


             However, a user with Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled,
             can   SEND  messages  to  users  who  have  given  a  REFUSE
             USER-MESSAGES command, but not the TERMINAL INHIBIT command.


   Hints

        Finding the Receiver's Line Number

             To find the terminal line number for the receiver of a  SEND
             message,  give  the  SYSTAT command with the receiver's user
             name as an argument.

        Sending Terminal Bells

             To get the attention of the user at the receiving  terminal,
             type  a  few  CTRL/Gs  in  your message.  This will ring the
             terminal bell on the receiving terminal.

        SEND in a Batch Job

             You can place SEND commands in a batch control file to  send
             messages  to  your  terminal  on  the condition of a running
             batch job.  Since your  username  is  associated  with  your
             batch  job  and  your  timesharing  job, use the line number
             argument.

        SEND as an Alternative to Mail

             The SEND command can be used as an alternative to sending  a
             message  with one of the mail programs.  For short messages,
             SEND can be more convenient and faster to use  than  a  mail
             program.   For  urgent  messages,  a  SEND  message  is read
             immediately by the receiver, unlike a  mail  message,  which
             can be read at the user's leisure.


   Special Cases

        User Has More Than One Job

             If you attempt to SEND a message to a user who is  logged-in
             on  more  than one terminal, the system responds with a list
             of the user's terminal line numbers and the  programs  being
             run  at  each  terminal.   Type your choice of terminal line
             number (if available, one running the EXEC) after  the  TTY:
             prompt.

                                 date and time.  This line  contains  the
                                 time  of day and your message.  The sign
                                 (+), used with the day-of-week and TODAY
                                 arguments,  adds the time you specify to
                                 the beginning of the  day  (00:00:00  or
                                 midnight).  For example, the command SET
                                 ALERT THURSDAY +10:00 sets an alert  for
                                 Thursday  at 10:00 A.M.  If you omit the
                                 plus sign after a day-of-week  or  TODAY
                                 argument,  the  time  is  interpreted as
                                 part  of  the  message.   When  a   time
                                 argument  is  used without a day-of-week
                                 or TODAY argument, the  plus  sign  adds
                                 the  specified time to the current time.
                                 For example, the command SET ALERT +1:00
                                 sets an alert for one hour from the time
                                 the command is given.

                                 If  the  SET  AUTOMATIC  command  is  in
                                 effect,  this  message is sent no matter

                                 If you give a fork the name of a program

                                 assigned  in  the  SET  PROGRAM command.
                                 For  example,  suppose  you  have  given

                                 If only COMPUTE is  in  memory  and  you

                                 A fork must have a unique name.  If  you

                                 name as another fork, the system appends
                                 a  digit  to the new name.  For example,
                                 if you attempted to name two forks EDIT,
                                 the second fork would be named EDIT0.

                                 the  fork  name  as  an  EXEC   command.
                                 CONTINUE begins the program at the point
                                 where  it  was   interrupted.    REENTER
                                 begins   the   program  at  its  reentry
                                 address (for most programs  the  reentry
                                 address   is   the  same  as  the  start
                                 address).  START begins the  program  at
                                 its  start  address.  The system informs
                                 you when the fork  is  "kept"  with  the

                                 type the  kept  fork  name,  the  system
                                 responds        with       §lbrack[]CONTINUING§rbrack[],

                                 characteristics are separated by commas.

                                 The name argument can be a maximum of 14
                                 characters  per  characteristic and must

                                 Although much of the  above  information
                                 is  also  provided  by  the  INFORMATION

                                 commands,   these   commands   can  only
                                 display information while your  terminal
                                 is   at   EXEC   command   level.    The
                                 STATUS-WATCH     interrupt     character
                                 functions  from  EXEC  or program level.
                                 In  addition,  the  interrupt  character
                                 displays the status of an executing EXEC
                                 command (for example, COPY).

                                 To check the status of pages mapped to a
                                 program,  you  must specify one of these
                                 subcommands:  PAGES,  or  TOPS-10-PAGES.
                                 The  interrupt character always displays
                                 the  pages  opened  by  the  EXEC,   for
                                 example  the  pages  opened  by  a  COPY
                                 command.   When  an  EXEC   command   is
                                 processing,  only  the  EXEC's pages are
                                 checked.  If no command is in  progress,
                                 the  current  fork's  address  space  is
                                 checked.  If there is no  current  fork,
                                 no checking takes place.

                                 For  efficiency  and   to   reduce   the
                                 overhead  of  this command, a maximum of
                                 512 pages (not including EXEC pages) are
                                 checked   by  the  interrupt  character.
                                 These pages do not have to be contiguous
                                 or in the same section.

                                 To    simplify    your    typing,    SET
                                 STATUS-WATCH   accepts   subcommands  as
                                 arguments on the command line.

                                 INTERRUPT "^x" is a required  subcommand
                                 that   sets   a   control  character  or
                                 character  sequence  that,  when   typed

                                 The interrupt character can be a  single
                                 control  character  or  a  two-character
                                 sequence enclosed in double quotes.  For
                                 example,  "^B",  "DF",  "^QW"  are valid
                                 interrupt      characters.       Control
                                 characters  that are already used by the
                                 system,  such  as  CTRL/C  and   CTRL/T,
                                 cannot be redefined by SET STATUS-WATCH.
                                 See Appendix D for  a  list  of  defined
                                 system control characters.

                                 A two-character  interrupt  sequence  is
                                 job-wide and can be issued from any EXEC
                                 level.  If another program in  your  job
                                 defines    a   two-character   interrupt
                                 sequence  (for  example  the  SET   HOST
                                 command  with  the  CTERM-SERVER),  this
                                 sequence supersedes the SET STATUS-WATCH
                                 interrupt  sequence.  A single-character
                                 interrupt applies only  to  the  current
                                 EXEC   level.    Also,   the   interrupt
                                 character is not echoed on the terminal.

                                 NO  INTERRUPT  disables  the   interrupt
                                 characters.

                                 PAGES nn adds the specified octal  pages
                                 (nn)  or  range  of  pages  (n:m) to the
                                 pages   checked   by    the    interrupt
                                 character.  Multiple pages and ranges of
                                 pages can be specified by separating the
                                 pages  with  commas.   For example, PAGE
                                 100:40, 350 specifies pages 100  through
                                 140 and page 350.

                                 NO PAGES disables checking for all pages
                                 except pages used by the EXEC.

                                 The total number of mapped pages checked
                                 by    the   interrupt   character   (not
                                 including EXEC pages) cannot exceed 512.
                                 Generally, programs map pages within the
                                 range of 0:777.

                                 TOPS-10-PAGES adds  the  pages  used  by
                                 PA1050  (for  TOPS-10  compatibility) to
                                 the  address  space   checked   by   the
                                 interrupt character.

   Characteristics

        Affect Only Current Terminal Session

             The SET command, except for  SET  DIRECTORY  and  SET  FILE,
             applies  to  the  current terminal session only, and in most
             cases only to the current level of TOPS-20 in that  session.
             Therefore  put  SET  DEFAULT,  SET CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY, SET
             PROGRAM, and other SET commands into your COMAND.CMD file if
             you  want them to be in effect every time you log in or give
             the PUSH command.  Place commands that apply to any level of
             TOPS-20 in your LOGIN.CMD file.

        SYSTEM:REMOTE-PRINTING.CMD

             The  system-wide  file  REMOTE-PRINTING.CMD   contains   SET
             REMOTE-PRINTING  commands  to  establish printer aliases and
             characteristics    values.     The    SET    REMOTE-PRINTING
             SYSTEM-DEFINITIONS   command   sets   up   remote   printing
             information  for  a   job   based   on   the   settings   in
             REMOTE-PRINTING.CMD.  Internal tables are built that consist
             of the command arguments.  These tables are used to validate
             the   /CHARACTERISTIC   and  /REMOTE-PRINTER  switch  values
             specified by the user.

             You can invoke  the  SET  REMOTE-PRINTING  SYSTEM-DEFINITONS
             command at command level or within a command file.


   Hints

        Using SET PAGE-ACCESS

             A SET PAGE-ACCESS command can take several arguments on  the


                                   2-365

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                   §textbf[(SET)]


             same   line,  with  cumulative  effect;  contradictions  are
             resolved  in  favor  of  the  last  item  given.    So   SET
             PAGE-ACCESS  6  EXECUTE  NO  COPY-ON-WRITE NO WRITE allows a
             user to execute page 6 but not to change it; SET PAGE-ACCESS
             7 NO WRITE WRITE allows changes to page 7.

        To Make Modifiable Copies of Write-protected Programs

             Because the SAVE command preserves the write  protection  of
             files,  you  should  use  the  SET  PAGE ACCESS WRITE or SET
             PAGE-ACCESS COPY-ON-WRITE command before giving SAVE if  you
             want to save a modifiable copy of a program.

        Using SET TIME-LIMIT

             Although the SET TIME-LIMIT command is  ordinarily  used  by
             the  batch  system  to  limit  the  runtime of jobs, you can
             employ it as a timesharing user to give you  a  fatal  error
             message  when  the  specified  amount  of  CPU time has been
             spent.  To find out how much of this  time  you  have  left,
             give   the  SYSTAT . LIMIT  and  INFORMATION  PROGRAM-STATUS
             commands.  The difference between  the  SYSTAT . LIMIT  time
             and  the  "Used" time reported by INFORMATION PROGRAM-STATUS
             tells you the approximate time remaining.


        SET Commands Useful for Debugging Programs

             SET ADDRESS-BREAK

                  SET ADDRESS-BREAK shows you  how  often  and  for  what
                  purpose  a  memory  address  is  referenced.   When  an
                  address break occurs, a message will  show  the  memory
                  location  at  which  execution  of  your  program  will
                  resume.

             SET  NO  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY,   SET   UUO-SIMULATION,   SET
                  PAGE-ACCESS

                  If  you  are  debugging  a  program,  use  the  SET  NO
                  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY command to ensure that you can use
                  CTRL/C to leave the program.  Test a program that traps
                  CTRL/Cs  by having it trap, say, CTRL/As instead during
                  debugging.  Also, setting NO  CONTROL-C-CAPABILITY,  NO
                  UUO-SIMULATION,    or    PAGE-ACCESS    NO   WRITE   NO
                  COPY-ON-WRITE will show you what part  of  the  program
                  (if any) is attempting to use these features.

             Even if you do not have sufficient privileges to use the SET
             FILE  PROHIBIT  command, you can still do something to delay
             the removal of important files to off-line storage.

             Create a file named MIGRATION.ORDER in  each  directory  for
             which  you  wish to control migration.  The contents of this
             file should be the specifications of files that you want  to
             be migrated first, when migration is performed.  You may use
             wildcard characters (* and %) to specify more than one file.
             To  protect  source programs, for example, you could specify
             that executable programs and binary files be migrated first,
             by  listing  "*.EXE,  *.REL" in MIGRATION.ORDER.  To protect
             edited files, you  could  list  "*.Q*"  (this  ensures  that
             unedited  back-up  files  produced  by  the  EDIT program be
             migrated before the edited versions).

             Any files not listed in MIGRATION.ORDER  will  be  protected
             from  migration  until  all listed files have been migrated.
             Remember that, even without being listed in MIGRATION.ORDER,
             files  are  not usually migrated to off-line storage if they
             have been used or changed within a period of time  specified
             by your system manager.

             The SET FILE RESIST command also offers  limited  protection
             against involuntary migration.

        Using SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER

             It is possible that two  remote  queue  names  on  different
             clusters  may be the same or that a remote queue name may be
             the same as a LAT port or service  name.   The  target  node
             name  or actual name form of the SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER
             command resolves this problem.  The node name or server name
             distinguishes  one  identically  named printer from another.
             For example, the following two  commands  would  help  avoid
             confusion in such an instance:

             SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER ODIE LASER LAT1
             SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER GARFIELD LASER VAXNOD

        Using SET Commands in Batch Jobs

             Put SET commands  into  a  BATCH.CMD  file  in  your  log-in
             directory  if  you want them to apply to the first (highest)
             level of TOPS-20 in batch jobs you  submit;  put  them  into
             COMAND.CMD  in  your  log-in  directory  if you want them to
             apply to all levels of TOPS-20 in both batch and interactive
             jobs.    Remember,  though,  that  you  must  not  give  SET

             (or the ATTACH command) within any batch job.

        Using SET DIRECTORY Commands

             You will be able to use the SET DIRECTORY commands  only  if
             your  system  is instructed at system start-up time to allow
             them.  Otherwise, the system will send you error messages in
             response to SET DIRECTORY commands.

        Using SET REMOTE-PRINTING Commands

             In supporting host  initiated  connections  to  LATprinters,
             TOPS-20 users are limited to six character server names.

             The remote printer functionality on TOPS-20 does not include
             features  to  allow  remote  systems  to  access  a  printer
             facility local to a TOPS-20 system.

            Then give the PAGES subcommand to specify the range of  pages

   §textbf[2.72]  §textbf[SET] §textbf[HOST]

   Function

        Connects your terminal to another system.


   Format 1

        @SET HOST node-name::  /switch


   Format 2

        (Omitting the node name on the command line allows you to  define
        an interrupt sequence)

        @SET HOST /switch
        Two character interrupt sequence (^\,<RET>): interrupt-sequence
        Node name: node-name::

        where:

        node-name::         is the name of the remote host that you  want
                            to connect your terminal to.  Two colons (::)
                            following the node name are optional.

        /switch             is  an  optional  keyword  that  selects  the
                            service  used  to  connect your terminal to a
                            remote node.
                                 Default - /CTERM

        interrupt-sequence  is the characters that switch control of  the
                            terminal  back  to  the  local host.  You are
                            prompted for an interrupt  sequence  only  if
                            you give the /CTERM switch.
                                 Default - CTRL\,<RET>

                                    NOTE

           This command description assumes you are connecting to
           another  TOPS-20 system.  For information on accessing
           other operating systems, see  the  §uline[DIGITAL]  §uline[Networking]
           §uline[Pocket]  §uline[Guide].   This command description also assumes
           that you are establishing a connection with the  CTERM
           program.

                         SET HOST Command Switches


        /CTERM         connects your  terminal  to  the  remote  node  by
                       running  the  CTERM  communications program.  Both
                       processors must be running DECnet Phase 4 software
                       (available  under  a  separate  license).  The SET
                       HOST command runs the CTERM communications program
                       by  default.   If the remote node does not support
                       the  CTERM  protocol,  SET   HOST   attempts   the
                       connection  again.  In the second attempt however,
                       SET HOST runs the communications  program  defined
                       by   the   logical   name   NRT: (Network   Remote
                       Terminal).
                            Default

        /NRT           runs the communications service program defined by
                       the  logical name NRT:  (Network Remote Terminal).
                       NRT: can be a system or job  logical  name.   When
                       both exist, the job definition takes precedence.


   Characteristics

        Logging into the Remote Node

             Once your terminal is connected  to  the  remote  node,  the
             system  responds  by identifying itself and prompting you to
             log in.  You can then log in to the system.

        Path of Terminal Input and Output

             The SET HOST command passes terminal input through the local
             host to the remote host.  Output from the remote host passes
             through the local host to your terminal.

        Making a Series of Host Connections

             Once you have logged in to a remote node, you can give  EXEC
             commands  and  run  programs just as you would on your local
             node.  You can then establish a connection to another remote
             node.   For  example,  if your local host is AURORA, you can
             give the command SET HOST BOSTON  to  connect  to  the  node
             BOSTON;  after logging in to BOSTON, you can use the command
             SET HOST DENVER to connect to node DENVER.

        Returning to Your Local Host

             To return  your  terminal  to  your  local  host,  type  the
             interrupt  sequence  to  temporarily break the connection to
             the remote host.  Note that the  connection  to  the  remote


                                   2-375

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                 §textbf[(SET] §textbf[HOST)]


             host  remains intact until you reset the CTERM program.  You
             can reconnect your terminal to the remote host by giving the
             CONTINUE command.

             When you log out of  the  remote  host,  the  connection  is
             broken and you are returned to your local host.

             If  you  have  established  a  series  of  connections,  the
             interrupt  character  defined in your first SET HOST command
             returns you to your local host.   For  example,  your  local
             host  is  AURORA  and you SET HOST to BOSTON, specifying the
             CTRL\<RET> interrupt sequence to  return  to  AURORA.   Then
             from  BOSTON  you  connect to DENVER.  Typing the CTRL\<RET>
             interrupt to DENVER returns you to AURORA, not BOSTON.

        Specifying the Interrupt Sequence

              o  The interrupt sequence  can  be  a  combination  of  two
                 characters  or control characters.  For example, KL ^KL,
                 K^L, and ^K^L are valid interrupt sequences.

              o  If you specify only one interrupt character, the  second
                 character  is ^J.  For example if you specify only ^N as
                 the interrupt sequence, the actual interrupt sequence is
                 ^N^J.   If  you  type  only F, the interrupt sequence is
                 F^J.

              o  Each  interrupt  character  must  be   different.    For
                 example, ^K^K is invalid, while ^KK is a valid interrupt
                 sequence.

              o  Do not  type  a  comma  or  a  space  between  interrupt
                 characters  as  it  will  be  interpreted  as the second
                 character in the sequence.

              o  The RETURN key can only be used in the default interrupt
                 sequence, ^\<RET>.

              o  The interrupt sequence cannot contain predefined TOPS-20
                 control  characters.   For  example,  if  you attempt to
                 specify an interrupt sequence as ^T^I, the ^T will print
                 the  run  status  and  the  ^I  will  print  a tab.  See
                 Appendix D in this manual for a list of TOPS-20  control
                 characters.

        Controlling Scrolling on a Remote Host

             On your local host, <CTRL/S> and <CTRL/Q>  are  the  default
             control   characters  that  pause  and  continue  scrolling.
             Typing <CTRL/Q> continues scrolling whether scrolling paused
             because  you  typed  <CTRL/S>  or  the  output  paused on an


                                   2-376

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                 §textbf[(SET] §textbf[HOST)]


             end-of-page.

             However, CTERM does not pass these characters to the  remote
             host.   When  using  <CTRL/S>  and <CTRL/Q>, it is the local
             host that actually controls scrolling.  Therefore if  output
             from  the remote host has paused on an end-of-page, <CTRL/Q>
             will not  continue  scrolling.   Other  pause  and  continue
             characters  are  passed  to  the  remote  host.  You can use
             <CTRL/A> to both pause and resume scrolling or you  can  use
             the  TERMINAL  PAUSE command to assign any two characters of
             your choosing to control scrolling.  For consistency, it  is
             recommended  that  you  define  the  same pause and continue
             characters on your local and remote node.

   §textbf[2.73]  §textbf[SKIP]

   Moves a magnetic tape set forward over a specified number of files  or
   records, or to the logical end of the tape set.


   Format

        @§textbf[SKIP] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]  §textbf[n] §textbf[units]

        where:

        dev:      is the name of the tape set or magnetic tape drive that
                  you want to move forward.

        n         is the number of files or records over which  you  want
                  to skip.  The colon after the device name is optional.

        units     is either FILES or RECORDS, where records are  sections
                  of  a  file; or LEOT, to skip to the logical end of the
                  tape set, which is the  next  point  on  the  tape  set
                  having two adjacent EOF (end-of-file) marks.
                       §textbf[Default] units - FILES


   Restrictions

        SKIP With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  file in a magnetic tape set and you then give the
             SKIP command for that tape set, the system will first ask if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             SKIP to succeed, but you will probably be unable to continue
             the  program  from  that  point because the file will now be
             closed.

        RECORDS Argument Used for Unlabeled Tapes Only

             You cannot use the RECORDS argument to the SKIP command when
             using  a labeled tape, because read and write operations for
             labeled tapes always move the tape to  the  beginning  of  a
             file.


   Warning

        Skipping Past LEOT (Unlabeled Tapes Only)

             If you specify too large a value for n in the  SKIP  command
             line,  you can move past the logical end of tape (LEOT).  In

             this case, the operator may have to  intervene  before  your
             tape  control  commands will have effect again.  You must be
             sure how many files you have in the tape set if you use SKIP
             n  rather  than  SKIP  LEOT.  This problem can occur for any
             tapes mounted on drives of the form MTAn:, or for  unlabeled
             tapes mounted on drives of the form MTn:.

            over the first file.  Use the COPY command to have  the  next
            file  (FIL-2)  printed  on  your terminal, then give the SKIP
            command again to skip to the logical  end-of-tape.   You  are
            skipping only one file, FIL-3, in this case.

   §textbf[2.74]  §textbf[START]

   Begins execution of the program in the current fork.


   Format

        @§textbf[START] (PROGRAM) §textbf[location]/§textbf[switch]

        where:

        location       is the octal or symbolic address  where  you  want
                       the program to start.
                       §textbf[Default] location - the  normal  starting  address,
                                          that  is, the first word in the
                                          program's entry vector

        switch         is  a  keyword,  chosen  from  the   list   below,
                       indicating your choice of START command options.


                           START Command Switches


   /BACKGROUND    keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command level and starts
                  execution  of the program in a "background" fork.  When
                  the program attempts to do terminal input or output, it
                  halts  and  displays  the  message §lbrack[]FORK-NAME wants the
                  TTY§rbrack[].

   /NORMALLY      restores your terminal to command level (if any) within
                  the program
                       §textbf[Default]

   /STAY          keeps your terminal at TOPS-20 command  level.   Output
                  from  the  program  is  sent  to  the  terminal  and is
                  intermixed with whatever output is currently displayed.
                  When the program attempts to read from the terminal, it
                  can randomly intercept input intended for the  EXEC  or
                  another  program.   Therefore,  use  this  switch  with
                  programs that, once started,  do  not  request  further
                  terminal input.


   Characteristics

        Starting a Noncurrent Fork

             When you START a noncurrent  fork,  the  fork  becomes  your
             current fork.

   Hints

        Further Information

             The START command is one of the  TOPS-20  multiforking-class
             commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
             section named  Running  Multiple  Programs  in  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].

             For more information about entry vectors,  see  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[Monitor] §uline[Calls] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].


   Special Cases

        Running COBOL Programs a Second Time

             After running a program (with a RUN or EXECUTE  command,  or
             with  a GET and START or LOAD and START combination) you can
             usually run it again using START.   COBOL  programs  are  an
             exception:  to run them again you must reload them.


   Restrictions

        Programs Competing for Terminal Input

             If you use START /STAY to run  a  program  in  a  background
             fork,  either  at  the  current  or  at a lower EXEC command
             level, (see Hints - Using PUSH to Get a New TOPS-20  Command
             Level,  above),  the  program  can  request  input  from the
             terminal while you are giving input to the EXEC  or  another
             program.   This  input  can  be  randomly intercepted by the
             background program when it requests terminal input.  Usually
             though, the EXEC or the current program receives the input.

             When  terminal  input  is  intercepted  by  the   background
             program, the program usually types input error messages.  To
             give input to the program, stop the program  by  typing  two
             CTRL/Cs  or  the  program's  exit  command.   Then,  if  the
             background program is at a higher EXEC command  level,  give
             POP  commands  to  return  to  the EXEC level that holds the
             background program.  (POP terminates the  current  EXEC  and
             erases  programs  in its memory.) Finally, give the CONTINUE
             /NORMALLY command; this puts you at program command level so
             that you can give the requested input.

             Input is intercepted by  the  background  program  randomly.
             Therefore,  you may have to type extra CTRL/Cs, program exit
             commands, and POPs.  To reduce confusion about the direction
             of  terminal  input,  it  is  recommended that you use START
             /STAY only when you plan to work at the current  EXEC  level

                                   2-384

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(START)]


             while  a  program  runs  in  a  background  fork.  Use START
             /BACKGROUND when you plan to work at a lower EXEC  level  or
             at another program command level.

             When  a  program  started  with  START  BACKGROUND  requests
             terminal  input,  it sends the message, §lbrack[]FORK-NAME wants the
             TTY§rbrack[].  No input is taken by the background program until you
             return to program command level with CONTINUE /NORMALLY.

        No I/O Control with Some Programs

             Most programs read and write data to  the  terminal  through
             standard   input  and  output  designators.   Some  programs
             however, use different methods  of  communicating  with  the
             terminal.   Therefore, when you use /BACKGROUND and /STAY to
             control terminal input and output from  a  background  fork,
             the  input  and output behavior of programs with nonstandard
             designators can be unpredictable.

        Execute-only Programs

             Programs that are execute-only can only be started at  their
             normal starting address.

                                    directory;  the  control files can be
                                    located  in  any   directory.    This

                                    SUBMIT commands.  See Example 5.

   Output

        Jobname, Request ID, and Time Limit

             As soon as you complete a valid SUBMIT command,  the  system
             responds by printing, on your terminal, the jobname, request
             ID, and time limit for  the  job.   Each  control  file  you
             submit  is  a  separate batch request, and is described on a
             separate line.

   Characteristics

        Switch Defaults Set by System Manager

             The defaults shown in the list of switches are  correct  for
             most  user  sites.   However, your system manager can change
             some of these default settings.  The changes go into  effect
             during  system  installation.   The  switches  most commonly
             affected are:  /CARDS, /FEET,  /OUTPUT,  /PAGES,  /PRIORITY,
             /TIME, and /TPLOT.

        Disposition of Log Files

             The    three    SUBMIT    command    switches    /BATCH-LOG,
             /LOGDISPOSITION,  and  /OUTPUT,  control what happens to the
             log file of your batch job.

        Where Written

             The log file is always written as the job  runs,  either  to
             the  batch  job's  connected  directory,  or  to a directory
             specified as argument to the  /LOGNAME  switch,  or  to  the
             system's output spooling area (it is written to the spooling
             area only if you give the /BATCH-LOG:SPOOL switch).  If  the
             /DESTINATION-NODE switch is also given, the log file will be
             written into a directory or spooling area at  the  specified
             node.   Remember  that  a batch job's connected directory is
             ordinarily defined to be your  connected  directory  at  the
             time  of  the SUBMIT command; privileged users may specify a
             batch   job's   connected    directory    by    using    the
             /CONNECTED-DIRECTORY switch.

        How Written, When Printed

             The  /BATCH-LOG  switch's  APPEND  and  SUPERSEDE  arguments
             describe  the manner in which the log file is to be written:
             either it is appended to any existing file of the same  name
             (usually produced by a previous running of the batch job) or
             it is  written  as  a  new  generation  of  the  file.   The
             /LOGDISPOSITION switch tells the system whether to keep this
             file,  wherever  it  is  written,  once  the  batch  job  is
             finished.   The  /OUTPUT  switch  specifies  when you want a
             listing of the log file to be printed:   either  always,  or
             never,  or  only  if errors occur when the batch job is run.
             By using combinations of these switches you  can  cause  any
             desirable   action.    Giving   /OUTPUT:ALWAYS   along  with
             /LOGDISPOSITION:DELETE allows a record  of  your  batch  job
             with only a temporary use of your disk area, and permits you
             to monitor the progress of the job while it is running (give
             TYPE  commands  to  view the file at your terminal).  Giving
             just the /BATCH-LOG:SPOOL switch allows a record without any


                                   2-394

             use  of  your disk area, although then you must wait for the
             printed output to see this record.

        Execution of Command Files

             As soon as one of  your  batch  jobs  logs  in,  the  system
             processes  your  login  directory's  command  files  and the
             system's command files.  The files  are  processed  in  this
             order:

                  1.  SYSTEM:BATCH.CMD
                  2.  BATCH.CMD
                  3.  SYSTEM:COMAND.CMD
                  4.  COMAND.CMD

             If a LOGOUT command is included in the batch  control  file,
             the  system processes your login directory's LOGOUT.CMD file
             followed by  the  system's  SYSTEM:LOGOUT.CMD  file.   These
             files  are  not  processed  if  the  batch job is logged out
             automatically.

        Automatic Logout

             If the batch control file is  not  terminated  by  a  LOGOUT
             command,  the  batch job is logged-out automatically and the
             message "KILLED BY OPERATOR TTYnn" is  printed  in  the  log
             file.


   Hints

        Using SET DEFAULT SUBMIT

             If there are switches that you always or usually supply when
             using  SUBMIT,  give  the  SET  DEFAULT  SUBMIT  command  to
             establish  them  as  defaults  for  the  remainder  of  your
             terminal  session.   The switches will then behave as if you
             had typed them directly after  the  word  SUBMIT.   You  can
             supersede   any   of  these  default  switches  by  actually
             supplying the switch, with another value, when you give  the
             SUBMIT command.

                  For Future Terminal Sessions

                       Put SET DEFAULT SUBMIT commands into a file  named
                       COMAND.CMD  or  LOGIN.CMD in your log-in directory
                       if you want these default switches to be in effect
                       for  batch  jobs you submit during future terminal
                       sessions as well.  If both files exist, the system
                       reads LOGIN.CMD first.

                                  §textbf[(SUBMIT)]


                  For Nested Batch Jobs Only

                       Put SET DEFAULT SUBMIT commands into a file  named
                       BATCH.CMD  in  your  log-in  directory if you want
                       them to be in effect  at  the  log-in  time  of  a
                       "nested"  batch  job  only,  that  is, a batch job
                       started by a SUBMIT  command  within  the  control
                       file   of  another  of  your  batch  jobs.   Note,
                       however, that the system also reads COMAND.CMD  at
                       the  log-in time of a batch job if the file exists
                       in your log-in  directory.   It  reads  this  file
                       after BATCH.CMD.

             Monitoring the Progress of a Batch Job

                  You can include the SEND command or the  commands  that
                  run  the MAIL or DECmail/MS mail programs in your batch
                  control file.  Use these commands to send  messages  to
                  your terminal informing you of the status of your batch
                  job.  Since a batch job creates a job  in  addition  to
                  your  timesharing  job,  use  the  terminal line number
                  argument instead of the user name argument in the  SEND
                  command.

        More Information

             For more information about batch jobs,  see  the  §uline[TOPS-10/20]
             §uline[Batch] §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual].


   Restrictions

        Access Rights for Batch Jobs

             For Specifying Control Files and Log Files

                  You cannot use the ACCESS command to obtain  the  right
                  to submit control files from another directory, because
                  your batch jobs are logged in with rights only to  your
                  connected  directory  and  to  directories to which you
                  (through your login directory name) have  access  as  a
                  group  member.   The  control  file,  if  not  in  your
                  connected directory, must be in one to which  you  have
                  read   access   as   a   group  member;  the  log  file
                  specification, if  you  give  one,  must  be  for  your
                  connected  directory or for one to which you have write
                  access as a group member.

             For Use Within the Batch Job

                  Although it is possible  to  give  CONNECT  and  ACCESS


                                   2-396

                            §textbf[COMMAND] §textbf[DESCRIPTION]
                                  §textbf[(SUBMIT)]


                  commands  within  a  batch  job to obtain rights beyond
                  those mentioned above, you may  then  have  to  include
                  passwords  in  the  job's  control  file.  Because this
                  practice  could  endanger  system   security,   it   is
                  generally  best  to  establish  and rely on appropriate
                  group rights when preparing batch jobs for submission.

        PUSH During Batch Job Execution

             Note  that  a  PUSH  command  reads  the  COMAND.CMD   file.
             Therefore,  if  your  batch  control  file  contains  a PUSH
             command, only the defaults set in COMAND.CMD are  in  effect
             while in the inferior EXEC.

        Editing a Queued Control File

             The batch system processes the exact version of the  control
             file  specified  in  your SUBMIT command.  Therefore, if you
             edit a file while it is in the batch queue, the new  version
             of the file will not be processed.

             To change the request to process the latest version  of  the
             control file, CANCEL the request and resubmit the job.

                             SYSTAT Subcommands


        ALL                  gives all available SYSTAT information

        CLASS                prints the scheduler class in which each job
                             is  running;  the  share  of  total CPU time
                             allotted to the job, expressed as a  decimal
                             fraction; and the fraction of total CPU time
                             actually used by the job.   A  job's  actual
                             use may be larger than its allotted share if
                             some jobs in its class are inactive; it  can
                             be   larger   still  if  other  classes  are
                             inactive and this  unused  fraction  of  CPU
                             time is being allocated among active jobs.

|       CONNECT-TIME         prints how long each user has been connected
|                            to the system.

        CONTROLLING          prints, in the column headed CJB, the number
                             of  the controlling job (if any), that is, a
                             job  owning  a  PTY  (pseudo-terminal)  that
                             controls  the job being described; when used
                             in a SYSTAT command requesting  descriptions
                             of  particular  jobs, this subcommand causes
                             jobs  controlled  by  these   jobs   to   be
                             described also.

        DIRECTORY            requests the name of the directory to  which
                             each  job  is  connected,  if  not the job's
                             log-in directory.

        HEADER               calls for a headline identifying the columns
                             of information printed

                             number n; can be used more than once.

        LIMIT                prints any time limit set for each job  with
                             the  SET  TIME  LIMIT  command.   Print  the
                             amount of CPU time used  by  your  job  with

             First  you  see  the  current  date  and  time  (in  24-hour
             notation:   the  sample  above was obtained 37 seconds after
             3:48 P.M.), and the length of  time  since  the  system  was
             started (here, just over 1 hour).

             The second line displays the number of user  jobs  (45)  and
             operator  jobs  (11)  currently  running.   The  next  three
             numbers are the "load averages" for the system:   these  are
             weighted averages of the number of runnable processes on the
             system over the last minute,  5  minutes,  and  15  minutes,
             respectively.   (If  class  scheduling is enabled, the three
             load averages are the average number of jobs having at least
             one  runnable  process, and apply to the class in which your
             job is running.)  If you are about to start a job  requiring
             5  minutes  of CPU time, and the load average remains stable
             over the period in question, for example, becomes 4.54 (3.54
             + your job = 4.54), then you can count on your job's getting
             about  1/4.54  of  your  class's  share  of   the   system's
             attention.   If  your  class  is  assigned  one third of the
             system's CPU time  and  you  do  not  receive  any  windfall
             (unclaimed  CPU time), your job will be finished in a little
             over one hour.

             After this comes the line of headings labeling  each  column
             of  data  that  follows.   All  but  the  User,  Origin  and
             <Directory> columns of  information  appear  in  the  sample
             above,  describing  all jobs (rows).  The unmodified command
             SYSTAT displays the Job,  Line,  Program,  User  and  Origin
             columns.   The  Origin column displays the job's originating
             host followed in parentheses by the network  terminal  type.
             For  example,  AURORA (CTM) means that the user logged in to
             node AURORA and  then  used  the  CTERM-SERVER  protocol  to
             connect his terminal to this system.  The definitions of the
             network terminal types are:

                  CTM       CTERM-SERVER protocol terminal
                  LAT       Local Access Terminal
                  NRT       Network Remote Terminal
|                 TCP       Internet TCP/IP Terminal

             By  using  appropriate  subcommands  you  can   select   the
             categories  of  information,  as  well as the specific jobs.
             (The Class (Cls) and Share (Shr) categories appear  only  if

             class  scheduling  is enabled.)  User jobs, both timesharing
             and batch, are listed  first  (in  ascending  order  by  job
             number),  and  then, after a blank line, operator jobs.  The
             number of the job attached to your own terminal appears with
             an asterisk (*) next to it in the Job column.

        Sending Output Elsewhere

             By giving  the  OUTPUT  subcommand  you  can  direct  SYSTAT
             information  to  a  file  instead  of to your terminal.  The
             subcommand LPT sends the information to the printer  instead
             of to your terminal.


   Characteristics

        Log-in Not Necessary

             You do not have to be logged in to give the SYSTAT  command.
|            However,  the  system manager can disable the SYSTAT command
|            for users not logged in.


   Hints

        Giving Subcommands as Arguments on the Command Line

             To simplify  your  typing,  SYSTAT  accepts  subcommands  as
             arguments  given on the same line as the command, subject to
             these rules:

                  There will be  no  @@  prompt:   simply  type  a  space
                  between  successive  subcommands and between subcommand
                  names and arguments.

                  To get information  about  one  or  more  specific  job
                  numbers, give the numbers only; do not type JOB.

                  To get information about  one  or  more  specific  user
                  names,  give  the names only; do not type USER.  But if
                  the user name is by coincidence the same  as  a  SYSTAT
                  command  argument,  you must use the subcommand mode to
                  request information about his job.

                  To get information about one or  more  specific  log-in
                  directories, give the directory names.§lbrack[]1§rbrack[]

   §lbrack[]1§rbrack[]  For specific connected directories, specify the  directory  names
   (and  structures,  if  not the public structure) along with either the
   ALL or DIRECTORY subcommand.

                  To get information about your own (attached) job  only,
                  give a period (.) as argument.

                  To get information about all other jobs logged in under
                  your  user  name,  give  your  user  name  and NO .  as
                  arguments.

                  The system will not accept  the  OUTPUT  subcommand  in
                  this format; use the subcommand mode instead.


   Special Cases

        OPERATOR as a User Name

             You can request or refuse information about operator jobs by
             treating  OPERATOR as a user name.  The system accepts these
             commands:

             --------------

                  @SYSTAT OPERATOR

                                  specified file.


   Output

        The output from a TAKE command consists of the  output  for  each
        command  in the command file you specify as argument, followed by
        the message, End of filespec, that indicates successful execution
        of all the commands in this file.


   Characteristics

        Running Programs From a Command File

             If you put commands that run programs  (including  the  PUSH
             command)  into  a  command  file, and these programs ask for
             arguments, you must be ready to type in these  arguments  at
             your  terminal.  Only TOPS-20 commands and command arguments
             can be put into a command file executed by the TAKE command.


   Hints

        Suppressing the Final Message

             If you want to suppress the final message (of the form,  End
             of  filespec)  that  indicates  successful  execution  of  a
             command file by TAKE, give a TAKE command with no  arguments
             as the last line of your command file.


   Special Cases

        Nested TAKE Commands

             In the case of nested TAKE commands (those given as commands
             within   command  files),  the  destination  for  output  of
             commands given in an inner command file will default to that
             specified or assumed for the output of commands given in the
             nearest surrounding command file.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The TAKE command affects memory and your  terminal  according  to
        the commands stored in the command file you specify as argument.

   §textbf[2.78]  §textbf[TALK]

   Allows you to converse with other users  on  your  system  by  linking
   terminals.


   Format

        @§textbf[TALK] (TO) §textbf[argument]

        where:

        argument     is a user name or terminal line number.


   Characteristics

        Typing TALK Conversation

             During a TALK session, you must tell the  system  to  regard
             your   conversation  as  comments.   Otherwise,  the  system
             interprets your input as attempts to give EXEC commands  and
             responds  with the message ?Unrecognized command.  To signal
             your input as comments, begin each line with the exclamation
             point  (!)  or semicolon (;) comment character.  Or, if your
             comment is several lines long, use the REMARK command.

        Other Job Not Affected

             As  soon  as  you  give  a  successful  TALK  command,  both
             terminals  begin  printing  both users' input as well as the
             system's responses to that input.  Each job,  however,  will
             receive input from its own terminal only.

        Ending TALK

             To end a conversation link between  terminals,  either  user
             can give the BREAK command.

        Refused TALK

             Terminals can be set to refuse links  with  other  terminals
             with  the  REFUSE LINKS or TERMINAL INHIBIT command.  If you
             attempt to TALK to a user who has refused links from another
             terminal,  the  system rings the bells on both terminals six
             times, and then prints the message, ?Refused, Send  mail  to
             user   instead.   If  the  user  has  refused  all  terminal
             communication with the TERMINAL INHIBIT command, the  system
             does not ring the bell on his terminal.

             If you have Wheel or Operator capabilities enabled, you  can

                                   §textbf[(TALK)]


             TALK to any user who has given the REFUSE LINKS command, but
             not the TERMINAL INHIBIT command.

        Maximum of Four Terminals

             By using TALK commands, you can link up to four terminals at
             once.   For  all  terminals  to share the same display, each
             pair of terminals must establish a link.   For  example,  if
             terminal  A  is  linked  to  B and C, terminals B and C will
             display only A's input.  B and C must establish  a  link  to
             display each other's input.


   Hints

        Signaling a Linked User

             Once you have established links with another user's terminal
             via  the TALK command, you can get his attention by typing a
             series of CTRL/Gs.  Depending on the  kind  of  terminal  he
             has,   these   will   be  reproduced  as  ringing  bells  or
             high-pitched beeps.  This action can  be  especially  useful
             when   establishing  links  with  the  owner  of  a  display
             terminal,  as  display  terminals  are  silent  in  ordinary
             operation.


   Special Cases

        User Has More Than One Job

             If more than one job is logged in under the  user  name  you
             specify,  the  system  responds  with  a list of that user's
             terminal line numbers and the programs being run.  Type your
             choice  of  terminal  line  number  (if  available,  the one
             running the EXEC) after the TTY:  prompt.

        Talking to a Batch Job or PTYCON Job

             When you link to a PTY  (pseudo-terminal)  to  talk  to  the
             owner  of  a batch job or PTYCON job, the system informs you
             of this with a message, to  which  you  must  reply  with  a
             carriage  return  to confirm the link.  To decline the link,
             give a CTRL/C.  See also Warning, Talking to  a  Batch  Job,
             below.

   Warning

        Talking to a Batch Job

             Use   caution   when    communicating    through    a    PTY
             (pseudo-terminal)  that  is controlling a batch job:  do not
             send a question mark (?) or percent sign (%), because  these
             characters  can be attributed to errors occurring within the
             job.  Also, if an error actually does occur in the batch job
             and  the  batch system's question mark is displaced (by your
             remarks) from the beginning of a line, the  system  may  not
             recognize it as an error.

        Talking Between a VT100 and a VT52

             If links between VT100 and VT52  terminals  are  established
             using  a  TALK  (or  ADVISE)  command, the VT52 may function
             improperly during or after the linked interval (such  as  by
             requiring  frequent  CTRL/Q commands to print multiple lines
             of output).  Turning the terminal  off  and  then  on  again
             (after the linked interval) will correct this problem.

   DIRECTORY for magnetic tapes.


   Examples

        1.  Give a TDIRECTORY command, cancel the command with  a  CTRL/C
            after the first few (most recent) files are displayed.

            @§uline[TDIRECTORY]

   §textbf[2.80]  §textbf[TERMINAL]

   Sets the characteristics of your terminal.


   Format

        @§textbf[TERMINAL] (FEATURE or TYPE) §textbf[argument]

        where:

        argument     is  a  keyword,  chosen   from   the   list   below,
                     representing   your   choice   of  TERMINAL  command
                     options; some arguments further  require  a  decimal
                     number to complete their meaning.


        Summary of TERMINAL Command Arguments (defaults in boldface)

   The TERMINAL  command  arguments  are  divided  into  two  categories,
   feature   and   type.    Feature  arguments  set  individual  terminal
   characteristics and type arguments set a group of characteristics that
   are defined for the model of your terminal.

        FLAG                instructs  the  system  to  print  a   single
                            quotation   mark  (')  before  it  prints  an
                            uppercase character.  This takes effect  only
                            if you set the NO LOWERCASE parameter.

        FORMFEED            informs the system that your terminal  has  a
                            form  feed  mechanism;  otherwise, the system
                            simulates form feeds by printing the  correct
                            number  of  line  feeds  (set by the TERMINAL
                            LENGTH command) if you have set  TERMINAL  NO
                            INDICATE,  or  by  printing an ^L if you have
                            set TERMINAL INDICATE.

        FULLDUPLEX          instructs the system to send to your terminal
                            each character as the program reads it.  Your
                            terminal does not print what you  type  until
                            the  system  sends  the character back to the
                            terminal.  See also IMMEDIATE.
                                 §textbf[Default]

        HALFDUPLEX          inhibits the  system  from  sending  to  your
                            terminal  each  character,  and  assumes that
                            your terminal prints each  character  itself;
                            causes  echoing  of format control characters
                            (for example, TAB and line  feed).   Be  sure
                            also   to   set   any   corresponding  switch
                            physically located on your terminal.

        HELP                prints   information   about   the   TERMINAL
                            command.

        IMMEDIATE           instructs the system to echo  each  character
                            as  soon  as  you type it, instead of waiting
                            until the  program  receives  the  character.
                            Immediate  echoing  has  effect only when the
                            FULLDUPLEX parameter is also set.

        INDICATE            instructs the system to print a ^L instead of
                            advancing the proper number of lines whenever
                            encountering a form  feed  or  CTRL/L  (ASCII
                            character 14).
                                 §textbf[Default]

        INHIBIT             notifies the system that you are not  willing
                            to  receive  links,  advice, system messages,
                            and user messages.  Also stops beep  or  bell
                            signals from users attempting to TALK to your
                            terminal.  Only output from your own  job  is
                            displayed  on  your  terminal.   This command
                            disables the settings  established  with  the
                            RECEIVE and REFUSE commands.  Reestablish the
                            RECEIVE and REFUSE settings with NO INHIBIT.

        LENGTH n            sets the number  of  lines  printed  on  each
                            page.     (If   you   have   TERMINAL   PAUSE
                            END-OF-PAGE set as  well,  the  system  stops
                            after  printing  n  lines  and continues only
                            when you type CTRL/Q.) If you  set  the  page
                            length  to  0, the system stops printing only
                            when you type CTRL/S  (as  long  as  TERMINAL
                            PAUSE COMMAND is in effect also); it does not
                            automatically stop at the end of a page.
                                 §textbf[Default] n - 66

        LINE-HALFDUPLEX     inhibits the  system  from  sending  to  your
                            terminal  each  character,  and  assumes that
                            your terminal prints each  character  itself;
                            does  not  cause  echoing  of  format control
                            characters (for example, TAB and line feed).

        LOWERCASE           tells the system that your  terminal  handles
                            lowercase   output  characters  properly,  by
                            printing either the  lowercase  character  or
                            the  corresponding uppercase character.  When
                            NO LOWERCASE  is  set,  the  system  converts
                            lowercase    output    characters    to   the
                            appropriate   uppercase   characters   before
                            sending  them.   See  also the FLAG and RAISE

                            For argument END-OF-PAGE to stop your output,
                            argument COMMAND must also be in effect.  You
                            continue the output by typing CTRL/Q or the y
                            parameter of the CHARACTER argument.

                            For argument CHARACTER to stop  your  output,
                            the COMMAND and END-OF-PAGE arguments must be
                            in effect.  With the CHARACTER argument,  you
                            continue  output  by  typing the y parameter.
                            You can specify x and y in various ways:   as
                            the  octal  ASCII  code  for any character or
                            control key; as  any  printing  character  in
                            double  quotes  (" ");  as the word "control"
                            followed by the printing representation of  a
                            control  character  in double quotation marks
                            (for example, CONTROL "A"); and as  the  word
                            "space"  to  specify  the  space bar.  If you
                            specify x and y to be the  same,  or  if  you
                            omit  y,  you  get  a toggle effect.  You can
                            specify  CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  as  x   and   y
                            parameters,   respectively,   only  on  local
                            terminals.  (Network terminal connections  do
                            not  allow  for  CTRL/S and CTRL/Q.) But even

   Characteristics

        TERMINAL Commands Before Log-in

             You can use TERMINAL commands, after an  initial  CTRL/C  or
             RETURN  but  before  logging  in,  to adjust your terminal's
             characteristics.

   Hints

        Setting Your Terminal's Speed

             If the initial speed setting of your terminal  line  is  not
             what you want but your terminal will function at that speed,
             you can give a TERMINAL SPEED command even before log-in  to
             set the proper value.  If your terminal will not work at the
             initial speed, ask the operator to set an appropriate value.

        Using Split Speeds

             If you have a terminal that allows split speeds, you can set
             the  input and output speeds to different values.  This will
             allow you to take advantage of  fast  system  response,  for
             example,  without providing a needlessly fast input line.  A
             setting of 150 2400 will accomplish  this.   Note  that  you
             cannot  use  split  speeds  on  a terminal that is part of a
             DECSYSTEM-2020 system.  Note also that using split speeds on
             VT100,  VT125,  or  VK100  terminals  may  cause the "smooth
             scrolling"  feature  to  function   improperly.    See   the
             appropriate  terminal  manual, for example, the §uline[VT100] §uline[User's]
             §uline[Guide], for details.


   Special Cases

        Terminal Types and Defaults Peculiar to Your System

             The preceding  pages  describe  terminal  types  and  system
             defaults  as  they  are  shipped  with TOPS-20.  However, by
             making changes  to  the  monitor  and  the  TOPS-20  command
             processor,  your  installation  can  add  different terminal
             types and change the default characteristics associated with
             terminals.   Check with your system manager to find out what
             changes, if any, are in effect for your system.

        Terminal Speed Retained from Last Session

             Although most terminal  characteristics  revert  to  default
             settings  when you log in, the terminal line will retain the
             value for speed set by the last user of the line, even if he
             was  using  a  different  kind of terminal.  However, if the
             system failed and was restarted after the terminal line  was
             last  used,  the  initial  speed  will  be determined by the
             appropriate   TERMINAL   SPEED   command   in   the   system
             configuration file.  Also, dial-up lines return to the speed
             specified in this file after every use.

   Restrictions

        CTRL/S and CTRL/Q Not Passed to Remote Nodes

             CTRL/S and CTRL/Q are always processed by  your  host  node;
             they are not sent to a remote node.  Therefore, when you are
             connected to a remote node  with  the  SETHOST  program  and
             TERMINAL  PAUSE  (ON) END-OF-PAGE is set on the remote node,
             CTRL/Q will not continue scrolling.  CTRL/A is  the  default
             control  character recognized by the remote node for pausing
             and continuing scrolling.  You can use  the  TERMINAL  PAUSE
             (ON)  CHARACTER  command  to  specify the pause and continue
             characters of your choosing - except CTRL/S and CTRL/Q.   It
             is  recommended  that you define the same pause and continue
             scrolling characters on your host and the remote node.

        Disabling CTRL/S and CTRL/Q on High Speed Terminals

             Some terminal models, when set to a high receive baud  rate,
             such  as  9600, require that the CTRL/S and CTRL/Q pause and
             continue characters be enabled in order to correctly  format
             terminal output.  If you must disable CTRL/S and CTRL/Q with
             the TERMINAL NO PAUSE COMMAND, manually set the terminal  to
             fast or "jump" scroll.  If the output is still not correctly
             formatted, set a slower receive baud rate with the  TERMINAL
             SPEED command.  Then, manually set the same baud rate on the
             terminal.


   Warning

        Setting an Improper Terminal Speed

             If you  set  an  incorrect  speed  for  your  terminal,  for
             example,  one that is too high, you will be unable to use it
             further.  A TERMINAL SPEED command in the LOGIN.CMD file  in
             your log-in directory can cause the same problem.  In such a
             case, obtain your terminal  line  number  if  possible  (the
             second  column  of  SYSTAT  command  output consists of line
             numbers) and ask the operator to set an appropriate value.

   Hints

        Using Project-programmer Numbers

             Use project-programmer numbers instead  of  directory  names
             when  giving file specifications to programs written for the
             TOPS-10  operating  system.   These  include  the  assembler
             MACRO;  the FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL compilers; the linking
             loader  LINK;   and   utility   programs   CREF   (providing
             cross-reference   information)  and  FILCOM  (for  comparing
             files).

             If  you  are  unsure  whether  a  system  program   requires
             project-programmer numbers, load it into memory (using the R
             command), give a CTRL/C to return to TOPS-20 command  level,
             and  then  examine  memory with the INFORMATION MEMORY-USAGE
             command.  If the file PA1050.EXE (the TOPS-10  compatibility
             package)   is  present  in  memory,  then  the  program  was

             project-programmer  number where you would ordinarily give a
             directory name.

        Avoiding Project-programmer Numbers

             To avoid project-programmer numbers, define a  logical  name
             (of  6  or  fewer  characters) as the directory in question.
             Then use this logical name in place of  the  directory  when
             giving  file specifications.  The system program will accept
             the logical name as a device name, and will  then  be  using
             the correct directory.

   Output

        Entire Contents of Files

             In response to the TYPE command the system prints the entire
             contents  of  a  file (up to the EOF (end-of-file) pointer),
             including blank lines and line numbers if there are any.  If
             you  specify  more  than one file, the filespec precedes the
             contents of each file.

                                 §textbf[(UNATTACH)]


   §textbf[2.83]  §textbf[UNATTACH]

   Disengages another job from its terminal.


   Format

        @§textbf[UNATTACH] (USER) §textbf[name] (JOB #) §textbf[number]
        PASSWORD:§textbf[password]

        where:

        name         is the user name of the job's owner.

        number       is the job number.
                          §textbf[Default] number - the  only  job,  or  only  job
                                           besides      your      current
                                           (attached)  job,   logged   in
                                           under the user name you give.

        password     is the associated password (not requested if you are
                     currently  logged in under the same user name as the
                     job that you are disengaging).


   Characteristics

        Log-in Not Necessary

             You do not have  to  be  logged  in  to  give  the  UNATTACH
             command.


   Hints

        Freeing Hung Terminals

             The UNATTACH command is useful for freeing a terminal  that,
             because  of  program  or hardware errors, is no longer under
             control of the user.  The command UNATTACH  n  can  be  more
             effective than LOGOUT n for this purpose.


   Effect on Memory and Terminal

        The UNATTACH command does not affect memory and leaves  your  own
        terminal  at TOPS-20 command level.  The other job is left in its
        current state (usually suspended) and the disengaged terminal  is
        left in the state before log-in.

        ATTACH     for joining another job to your terminal

        DETACH     for disengaging your own job from its terminal


   Examples

        1.  Disengage another user's job from its terminal.

            Password:___

        2.  From a terminal on which you have not yet logged in, give the
            UNATTACH  command  to  disengage your only logged-in job from
            its terminal.

        3.  Give a SYSTAT command to find out what jobs you have running.
            Give the UNATTACH command for two of them (you must specify a
            job number for the first one so the system  will  know  which
            one you mean), and check them with another SYSTAT command.

   §textbf[2.84]  §textbf[UNDELETE]

   Restores deleted files.


   Format

        @§textbf[UNDELETE] (FILES) §textbf[filespec,...]

        where:

        filespec     is  the  specification  of  the  file  you  want  to
                     restore.
                          §textbf[Default] .gen - all generations of the specified
                                         files


   Restrictions

        Erasure of Deleted Files

             Ordinarily  an  UNDELETE  command  given  during  the   same
             terminal  session  as  an original deletion will recover the
             deleted files, unless you included the EXPUNGE subcommand to
             DELETE  or  gave  a subsequent EXPUNGE command.  However, if
             any user or a batch job  logs  out  while  connect  to  your
             directory,  all deleted files are permanently erased.  Also,
             if available disk space is low on the system,  the  operator
             or  the  system  itself  may  expunge  all deleted files.  A
             system warning message is usually sent before this happens.


   Special Cases

        Restoring Files Deleted With CONTENTS-ONLY Subcommand.

             Any files deleted by a DELETE command with  a  CONTENTS-ONLY
             subcommand  are  immediately  expunged.   You  must  use the
             RETRIEVE command to restore these to disk.

                                  §textbf[(UNKEEP)]


   §textbf[2.85]  §textbf[UNKEEP]

   Cancels the kept status of a fork.


   Format

        §textbf[UNKEEP] (FORK) §textbf[fork]

        where:

        fork is one of the following:  Fork name
                                       Fork number
                                            §textbf[Default] - the current fork


   Characteristics

        Unkept Forks

             An unkept fork is a fork that is cleared  from  memory  when
             another  program  is  loaded  or  when  the RESET command is
             given.  Forks are normally unkept unless kept with the  KEEP
             or SET PROGRAM KEEP commands.

        Inferior Forks

             The UNKEEP command simultaneously cancels the kept status of
             a superior fork and its inferior forks.


   Hints

        More Information

             The UNKEEP command is one of the TOPS-20  multiforking-class
             commands.   For more information about multiforking, see the
             section named  Running  Multiple  Programs  in  the  §uline[TOPS-20]
             §uline[User's] §uline[Guide].


   Effect on Memory

        The UNKEEP command does not immediately affect memory.  It  does,
        however,  allow  a  fork  in  memory  to  be cleared when another
        program is loaded or the RESET command is given.

   Examples

        1.  Give the INFORMATION FORK-STATUS command to display the  fork
            status.   Then,  give  the  UNKEEP command to cancel the kept
            status of the current fork and redisplay the fork status.

                                  §textbf[(UNLOAD)]


   §textbf[2.86]  §textbf[UNLOAD]

   Rewinds a magnetic tape until it is returned completely to the  source
   reel, and puts the associated tape drive offline.  Use UNLOAD only for
   tapes mounted on drives having device names of the form MTAn:.


   Format

        @§textbf[UNLOAD] (DEVICE) §textbf[dev:]

        where:

        dev:     is the name of the magnetic tape drive that you want  to
                 unload.


   Restrictions

        UNLOAD With Open Files

             If you have given a CTRL/C to exit from a program  that  has
             opened  a  magnetic  tape drive and you then gave the UNLOAD
             command for that tape drive, the system will  first  ask  if
             you  want  to close the associated file.  You must do so for
             UNLOAD to succeed,  but  you  will  probably  be  unable  to
             continue  the  program from that point because the file will
             now be closed.

        UNLOAD Not for MOUNTed Drives

             Use the UNLOAD command for tape  drives  obtained  with  the
             ASSIGN command.  Use DISMOUNT for a tape drive obtained with
             MOUNT.


   Warning

        Cannot Access Tape Again

             The UNLOAD command makes it impossible to access  your  tape
             again unless it is reloaded by the operator.


   Related Commands

        ASSIGN     for assigning a tape drive to your job

   §textbf[2.87]  §textbf[VDIRECTORY]

   The VDIRECTORY  (Verbose  DIRECTORY)  command  is  equivalent  to  the
   DIRECTORY command with the subcommands LENGTH, NO HEADING, PROTECTION,
   SIZE, and TIMES (AND  DATES  OF)  WRITE.   Use  the  same  format  and
   subcommands   with   VDIRECTORY   as   with  DIRECTORY.   For  further
   information see the DIRECTORY command description in this manual.

   When used with magnetic tapes, the VDIRECTORY command is equivalent to
   the DIRECTORY command for magnetic tapes.


   Examples

        1.  Give the VDIRECTORY command, then cut off the output  with  a
            CTRL/C.

                   §textbf[ALPHABETICAL] §textbf[LIST] §textbf[OF] §textbf[TOPS-20] §textbf[COMMANDS]



   This appendix consists of an alphabetical list of TOPS-20 commands and
   short  descriptions  of  each.   The  varieties  of argument needed to
   complete each command are shown next, in the order that you give them;
   parentheses   indicate  that  the  argument  is  optional  or  can  be
   defaulted.  Last comes the effect of the command  on  memory - whether
   it clears memory (by loading a program or by other means) or otherwise
   alters it, or leaves it unaffected.  Use this appendix along with  the
   question mark and recognition features to refresh your memory once you
   have become familiar with the contents of this manual.

                              §textbf[FILE] §textbf[ATTRIBUTES]



   This appendix lists the attributes that you  can  include  in  a  file
   specification.   The DECnet-related attributes are described in detail
   in the DECnet documentation.  Information on file attributes  is  also
   contained  in  the  §uline[TOPS-20]  §uline[User's]  §uline[Guide],  the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[Monitor] §uline[Calls]
   §uline[Reference] §uline[Manual], and the §uline[TOPS-20] §uline[Tape] §uline[Processing] §uline[Manual].

   ;A:account               System manager defined account string

   ;T                       Designation for a file that is to be  deleted
                            at log-out time (a temporary file).  Only for
                            files in log-in and/or connected directories.

   ;USERID:id               DECnet user ID string

   Note that  you  can  issue  TOPS-20  commands  as  an  alternative  to
   specifying  many  of  the  file  attributes.   For  example,  SET FILE
   PROTECTION, rather than the P attribute, can be used to set  the  file
   protection.   Also,  such  commands  as  INFORMATION  FILE-STATUS  and
   DIRECTORY (with the EVERYTHING subcommand) display your file attribute
   settings.

                                 APPENDIX D

                             §textbf[CONTROL] §textbf[CHARACTERS]



   This appendix lists the TOPS-20 control characters.  To type a control
   character,  use  the  CTRL key like the SHIFT key.  Hold down the CTRL
   key and at the same time type the character key.

   §textbf[CTRL]
   §textbf[CHARACTER]                          §textbf[FUNCTION]

   CTRL/C    Cancels a command when typed during command entry.

             Cancels command execution when typed  twice  during  command
             execution.  (The first ^C does not echo.)

             Halts a  program  and  returns  to  TOPS-20  command  level.
             Generally,  type  two  CTRL/Cs  to  halt  a  program that is
             executing; type one CTRL/C to stop a program that is waiting
             for input.

   CTRL/E    Ends an ADVISE command link between two terminals.

   CTRL/F    Provides  recognition  input  for  file  specifications  and
             command  names  and  arguments.   Similar to the ESCAPE key,
             except that it completes only one field at a time with  file
             specifications  and  it  does  not  supply  guidewords  with
             commands.

   CTRL/G    Rings the terminal bell.  Use with SEND and TALK commands to
             signal another user.

   CTRL/H    Reprints a command line up to the field that  is  in  error.
             Type  immediately after the input error message.  Duplicates
             the function of the BACKSPACE key.

   CTRL/I    Duplicates the function of the TAB key.

   CTRL/L    Advances the paper on a hard-copy terminal to the top of the
             next  page.  To stop the ^L from printing, give the TERMINAL
             NO INDICATE command.


                                    D-1

                             §textbf[CONTROL] §textbf[CHARACTERS]



   CTRL/O    Stops output to the terminal while the  program  or  command
             continues to execute.

             Output resumes when:
                  another CTRL/O is typed
                  the program or command finishes
                  the program prompts for input

   CTRL/Q    Continues scrolling  terminal  output  that  was  paused  by
             CTRL/S or a pause on an end of page.  Use the TERMINAL PAUSE
             (ON)  CHARACTER  command  to  define  alternate  pause   and
             continue   characters.   Use  the  TERMINAL  NO  PAUSE  (ON)
             END-OF-PAGE command to stop pause on an end  of  page.   Use
             the TERMINAL LENGTH command to set the page length.

   CTRL/R    Reprints  the  current  command  line,   incorporating   the
             corrections  made  with  the  DELETE  key or CTRL/W.  Use on
             hard-copy terminals when backslashes and underscores  caused
             by  editing  with  DELETE  and  CTRL/W make the command line
             difficult to read.  Use on video  terminals  when  a  system
             message covers the command line.

   CTRL/S    Pauses scrolling of terminal output until CTRL/Q  is  typed.
             Input,  though  not  displayed,  is  accepted into the input
             buffer and processed after a CTRL/Q.  Use the TERMINAL PAUSE
             (ON)   CHARACTER  command  to  define  alternate  pause  and
             continue characters.

   CTRL/T    Displays a line of information that includes:
                  the time
                  the name and status of the current fork
                  the amount of CPU time used
                  the time elapsed since login
                  the system's load average

   CTRL/U    Erases the current command line.   On  hard-copy  terminals,
             cancels  the  command  and prints three Xs at the end of the
             command line.

   CTRL/V    Allows special  characters  (any  character  other  than  an
             alphanumeric,  or the special characters - _ . or $) in file
             specifications and  directory  names.   Type  CTRL/V  before
             typing  the  special  character  any  time you type the file
             specification.

             Special characters are not accepted by the following  system
             programs:
                  ALGOL    COBOL    CREF    FILCOM    ISAM
                  LIBARY   LINK     MAKLIB  RERUN

   CTRL/W    Erases the previous word.  On hard-copy  terminals,  cancels

             the previous word and types an underscore.

   CTRL/Z    Signals an end-of-file for data entered from  the  terminal.
             Use when:
                  COPYing from your terminal (device TTY:) to a file.
